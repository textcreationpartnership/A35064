            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THat Arts, and all things have their Viciſſitude, Alienation, Death, and Renovation, dayly experience, and the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Fore-fathers, cleerly evidence. Their viciſſitude, by time, and our unconſtancy; their alienation, by our improvidence, and neglect; and their Death, by our corruptibility: but their renovation from God, and Nature, in rayſing up, and qualifying one, or more, ſingular Man, or Men, who reſtore and renovate, what the unconſtancy, neglect, and corruptiblity of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, have altered, perverted, and obliterated. If the uncertainty of mundane things be ſuch; it is no wonder, that what in one Age is highly eſteemed, in another becomes nauſeous, contemptible, and at length totally obſcured. For uſually, as ſoon, as any Science is invented, and put in Practice, it, as we, immediatly tends to change, depravedneſs, and annihilation. Thus hath it happ'ned to the Spagyrick Art, which for Antiquity is ſcarcely inferior to any, and for its uſe and benefit in the Medicinal part, moſt worthy of eſteem: yet becauſe Alchimy, and true Medicine (like <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes</hi>) were inſeparable, without the diſſolution of either, ſo ſoon as the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Science expired in the primitive Phiſitians, that Medicine by a like Fate was extinct alſo. For, when Impoſtors aſſumed theſe Arts, and converted the true, and genuine uſe of them into abuſe, they ſucceſſively declined, and thence forth were enervated, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, ſo, as both the one, and the other remained as dead, and if in the World, were not known, or diſcovered for many Ages, until that incomparably guifted Naturaliſt <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> preſented both in their priſtine beauty to the World. But at firſt ſight neither could find acceptance, eſpecially among the Learned, who with Tradition were ſo egregiouſly blinded, as between their judgement, and the vulgar cenſure (which decries all for monſtrous, that it ſelf hath no knowledge of) was little or no difference. Yet, in ſucceſs of time, by the indefatigable Induſtry of their <hi>Patron,</hi> they were admitted by
<pb facs="tcp:51328:3"/>ſome: afterward, the neceſſity of that time gave being to experience, whereby, what was before cenſured, and condemned by all, was then approved, and received by many. Nevertheleſs, as it hath happ'ned in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Notwithſtanding this, of his Diſciples not a few, with great diligence followed their Maſters footſteps, and although they could not arive to ſo great, an height of knowledge, in the unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Myſteries of God in Nature, as he did; yet with ſincerity, and uprightneſs, they preſſed after ſo exact an imitation of him, as by God and Nature was permitted to them; eſpecially in the Medicinal part of his Doctrine. In which, they could in no wiſe proceed aright, without the knowledge, and experimental underſtanding of <hi>AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHEMY</hi> in its manual Practice; therefore, they firſt ſet their hands to the work, as <hi>PARACELS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> himſelf did; and afterward practiſed Medicine to the glory of God, and for the good of their needy Neighbour. Among theſe, our Author here was not the leaſt, as by the ſubſequent Work is evident; who although a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of as good literature, and conſequently as well educated, as any in his time, diſdained not to foul his fingers; but, in his younger years, ſtudiouſly laboured in Pyrotechny firſt; and ſo, from a Chimical Laborator, aſcended to the degree of a Phiſitian; not forſaking his wonted diligence, and uſual obſervance of the wonders of Nature, diſcovered by Vulcanick Operations. Nor was he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful to take a View of Natur's own Work, in her ſignating indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of her own producing; as is evident by his ſubſequent Book of <hi>Signatures.</hi> Thus, in this <hi>Author</hi> you have his <hi>Royal Chimiſtry,</hi> which is the operation of Art, vegetated by humane induſtry; and his <hi>Signature</hi> of things, which is Natur's own Artifice, by Man obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, if a diſpoſition in Nature, and the deſire of doing good, prompt any Man, to ſeek after the knowledge of this neceſſary Science; and his Genius dictate, that the true entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into is by Induſtry, and manual Labour: for a guidance in this, he now hath the <hi>Tyrocinium</hi> of <hi>Beguinus</hi> in the Engliſh Tongue; which opens a gate for any ingenious intellect, with great facility to

                  <p>UNIVERSAL, Is that which exterminates the Roots of Diſeaſes, howſoever implanted in Humane Bodies, whether He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary from the Parents ſeed, or afterwards generated from evil uſe of aliment, or otherwiſe cauſed by External Impreſſions. This is performed by the Natural Balſome of remedies, conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to Humane Nature, <hi>(d)</hi> by Reſolving, Conſuming, and Diſſipating the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Tinctures of Impurities; but Corroborating, Conſolidating, and Preſerving the Innate Balſome; for (according to <hi>Paracelſus</hi>) as long as the Radical Humor is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, no Diſeaſe is perceived. <note place="margin">
                        <p>
                           <hi>There is one common Mummy of all men,</hi> viz. <hi>the ſpirit of life. The Medicine therefore may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be one. For the Diſeaſe in mans Body is nothing elſe but an Affect whereby the Mumy, or operation of the Spirit of life in man is hindered.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This is proved by various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, as of the Sun, Salt, Food, Poiſon, Air, and Fire, with which all men are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently affected. If the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of theſe Affects be curable, then the leaſt may certainly be healed.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> And whil'ſt every kind of Malady, is removed by one and the ſame Medicine, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, Particularities, and Orders of Indications, have no place.</p>
                  <p>Not without cauſe therefore <hi>Lully</hi> ſaith, that one Supreme and Univerſal Medicament, to which all particular Medicines are reduced, may be adminiſtred to Humane Bodies, without the knowledge of the Diſtemper; becauſe prudent Nature, by her own inſtinct hath given to it, Virtues of curing all natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and of rectifying her ſelf. There are four principal <hi>(e)</hi> kinds of Diſeaſes, exaited <hi>(f)</hi> and confirmed, which abſolutely need Univerſal Curation, (<hi>viz.</hi> Epilepſy, Gout, Dropſy, Lepronſy) to which ſtock, all other inferiour Diſeaſes, as to Fountains and Principals are deduced. This Univerſal Cure is to be deſired: but very <hi>(g)</hi> few are worthy of this Divine Gift. <hi>Raymund Lully</hi> diligently and faithfully adviſeth Phyſicians to ſtrive for perfection, and ſeek after the Univerſal Medicine, which is the only Sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of every Infirmity, <hi>(h)</hi> and the perfect Confortative of Spiritual Virtues, ſince that in it, as in one proper Subject is made a real and Univerſal Conjunction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and Collection of all operative Virtues, of the whole Medicine in the courſe of Nature; which Virtues are diſtributed by three natural familiar means, <hi>(i)</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe particularly, or without Order, Who ſo hath <hi>(k)</hi> an Antidote for all Diſeaſes in this World, the ſame hath the Gift of God, which is an Everlaſting, Incomparable, and Innumerable Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>What Infirmity ſoever is not by the adminiſtration of this natural competent Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51328:6"/>cured, (where this help is denied, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>PARTICULAR, is, which doth not always extirpate the Roots themſelves, <hi>(l)</hi> or Seminal Tinctures, but very often manifeſts its virtue in mitigating Dolours, Symptomes, and Paroxiſms, prohibiting their growth, not ſuffering them to come to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, appointing Evacuations of Excrements; and comforting debilitate Nature, with corroborating Remedies, conſentaneous to the natural Spirits, often varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to diverſity of Diſtempers. Nevertheleſs, this particular cure, is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; for it often, in moſt grievous Diſeaſes, performes the Office of the Univerſal; becauſe God by his great mercy hath manifeſted certain particular and general ſecrets, ſome which in themſelves, contain the nature of the whole Heavens, <hi>(m)</hi> others of the whole Air, <hi>(n)</hi> and others alſo of the whole Earth, <hi>(o)</hi> by which, Diſeaſes are eaſily known and cured: for Specifick and Appropriate Remedies made Spiritual, do often emulate the Univerſal Medicine, deſtroy the Roots of Impurities, and confirm the Virtue of the Natural Balſome. So as we ſhall be happy in defect of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, if we may at tain to particular, ſubalternate, ſpecifick and individual Species of Curations. Thus far <hi>Severinus.</hi>

                        <p>It is hitherto vulgarly thought the Hermetick Philoſophers, only uſed this Mercury as a Servant, <hi>(d)</hi> and fugitive Slave: neither can it be judged, that any one doth underſtand by their Philoſophical Writings, that they without any detriment would drink this Mercury. The true Philoſophick, and moſt noble Lympha, rarely diſcovers her ſelf to many, nor will ſhe attend upon any but true Philoſophers. Although ſhe be ſought of many, yet very few there be that find her. In Cabaliſtical Philoſophy, this is denoted by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (as our Saviour is denoted by the Ferment of Medicine), becauſe they affirm that ſhe, before, in, and after the Birth, was alwayes a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. But to our Medicinal Inſtitution.</p>
                        <p>This Vulgar <hi>(e)</hi> Mercury in a certain preparation, doſe, and mixture, becomes a divine <hi>(f)</hi> Medicine, and in very many Diſeaſes, far more efficaciouſly operates, (if it may be believed to be the ſame,) than that purified Panacea of former times, <hi>(g)</hi> which is prepared of powder of native Cinnabar, <hi>(h)</hi> moſt finely beaten, with Saffron, and Shell-fiſhes mixt; in the trial of which, by applying a ſmall part to the fire, I have very many times found, the crude Mercury to aſcend in a fume, which hath whitened a piece of Gold Coin.</p>
                        <p>In preparing Mercury, divers wayes have been experimented by Chymical Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51328:14"/>Some of which (and not evilly) have endeavoured to perform it by Spirit of common Salt Aqua-fortis, and Oyl of Vitriol, others by it ſelf, or with Flints, which is done in <hi>(i)</hi> length of time.</p>

Repeat the operation till the blackneſs be wholly removed, which in ſome Mercurys, (which are very foul) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a fourth part of their weight: Draw off the Spirit of Wine, by diſtillation in Balneo, leaving the blackneſs in the bottom. This Spirit of Wine, as alſo others thus uſed, carefully keep. By this purgation, the Mercury as a witneſs of its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, famouſly diſcovers it ſelf, in a moſt bright and perfect Celeſtial Colour. But the blackneſs muſt not be wholly thrown away, for it is uſeful in killing Lice and Worms, and may be uſed in a Girdle to that purpoſe, or as ſhall be otherwiſe thought fit.</p>

But as ſoon as you perceive the Spirit to ariſe, encreaſe the fire, that the glaſs may be a little hot, and appear ſomewhat rediſh; for, ſo in the Alembeck, and to the ſides of the Cucurbit, the unprofitable yellow, and duskiſn flowers will elevate themſelves from the Mercury. Cool the Veſſel, and take out the matter; break the Cucurbit, and rejecting the unprofitable flowers ſublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſides, you will find in the bottom a red powder, which in an Earthen Platter, waſh ſo long with hot Water, as till no ſharpneſs at all remain. To this powder, when dryed, pour Oyl of Salt of Tartar, till it be covered two fingers, abſtract the Phlegme by diſtillation in Sand thrice, but the third time encreaſe the fire, that the Cucurbit may with the heat be ſomewhat red, and by this means, a ſmall portion of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, crude or living will aſcend, which from the reſidue muſt be diligently ſeparated. The matter remaining in the bottom take out, and beat it groſsly to Powder, and with ſweet Water hot, waſh it often, till no Saltneſs or any other Impurity do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and the powder be left red and clear, which dry, and in a Cucurbit imbibe it with Water of Eggs, and ſeven times abſtract the ſame Water from it by Alembeck in Sand. What is left in the bottom, again waſh often with hot Water, and pour upon it ſeven times, rectifyed Spirit of Wine, then diſtill it, repeating the Cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as often.

                        <p>The expedient way of preparing the white Flowers is mentioned by the Author, and alſo in the aforeſaid place of <hi>Tyrocinium.</hi> But the work will more happily ſucceed, if an earthen Cucurbit be made of good matter, well coated, and have near the bottome a hole; and this be afterward placed firmly in a Furnace, and other Blind-heads with holes in them be aptly ſet upon it one within another, and thoſe in number ſix or more: And on the top placed a glaſſe Alembeck with a neck, to which a greater or regal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbit, may be fitly joyned for a Receiver.

                        <p>Red Flowers of Antimony are made, when powder of Antimony mixt with Sand, is expelled by an earthen Retort, or Cucurbit obliquely placed. For ſo the Antimony comes forth, in yellow and red Flowers, into the receiver, or great Cucurbit annexed. All the Flowers, both white and red, may be taken out; the red are more vehement, than the reſt. Alſo, the Flowers of Antimony are made in the common manner, by Sublimation in Pots, aptly placed upon an earthen Cucurbit one within another, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the fire gradually till at length it be more vehement, and the Flowers come forth, as well yellow, as white. <hi>Note.</hi> But little Antimony muſt be put in at one time.</p>
                        <p>The moſt commodious way of all is in the following manner.</p>
                        <p>Firſt let an earthen Cucurbit be made, not of great bulk, or belly, but almoſt of an equal bigneſs, from the upper Orifice to the bottome: to which, inſtead of a Receiver, aptly conjoyn an other veſſel, or oblique Inſtrument of like matter made, and ☞ well annealed: of two foot in length, and in the extreme part thereof ſhaped like a head, with a neck adjoyned, through which the Phlegme may paſs into another Receiver, for that purpoſe annexed.</p>

                        <p>The latter onely purge the Belly. The Compoſition, and uſe of both, hitherto by me kept in ſecret, I now faithfully communicate. Firſt of all, make an <hi>aqua fortis</hi> of Vitriol calcined to a yellowneſs, and common Salt of each 3 lib. to which add of Potters Earth twice or thrice ſo much, and mix it. Afterward by Retort in open fire draw off the the water, then in <hi>Balneo</hi> remove the Phlegme, that the Spirits may onely remain. Then ℞ white Flowers of Antimony, add an equal part of the ſaid water, and with gentle heat in <hi>Balneo</hi> remove the unprofitable Phlegme; for the Spirits co-operate with the Flowers, and onely ſend forth a waterneſs. Pour on freſh prepared Water, and as before draw off the Phlegme; this do ſo oft as till the Flowers be ſufficiently impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Spirits of the Waters, and the Waters retain in them no more Spirits. The Flowers thus impregnated, diſtill by Retort, and diligently receive the watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity which firſt comes forth; for it muſt be ſeparated from the matter. But when ſome white, weighty, and ſmall drops, begin to deſcend into the Receiver, apply ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Receiver, and gather the Oyle till no more will come forth, but an unprofitable <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put mortuum</hi> is left behind. (This Liquor comes forth juſt after the ſame manner as Butter of Antimony, or <hi>Mercurius vitae;</hi> wherefore it may here ſeem to be taken for it.) This Oyle in the Receiver, by little and little, Co-agulates and Cryſtalliſes, which muſt again the ſecond time by Retort be purified: the ſame Oyle will come forth, but more pure and excellent. This Oyle is the Baſis of the Emetick Pills, as well as of thoſe that only purge the Belly.</p>
                        <p>For if a ſmall part of this Oyle, be injected into diſtill'd Rain-water, it will be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pited into a moſt white, rate, and ſoft powder, which in the diſtill'd water muſt be often waſht from all its acrimony; and afterward mixed with as much purging extract, as ſhall be convenient to incorporate the Powder into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Hence it is manifeſt, and experience proves, that the preparation of Antimony is not only one, but many, which may only purge, and that very kindly, by the Inferior parts; which is contrary to the Opinion of our Author below, <note place="margin">

                           <hi>to his deſired wiſh that Antimony might be prepared only purging downward, the Author adds declaiming judgments, of opinions va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying from his, which is the experiences, and teſtimony of ſo many famous men. Antimony, as we have already ſaid, is prepared with a purging faculty only; for all the Emetick force of Antimony may be taken away, by requiſite Art, ſo as it ſhall neither purge by Siedge, nor by vomiting, but diaphoretically only. If therefore Art can remove all power of purging, it moſt certainly can retain in it the Cathartick property, and mitigate the other, or elſe wholly remove it. For if either part of its operation be alterable, according to variety of prepapations, it may alſo be aboliſht or retained, according to the ſame diverſity. And a little before our Author preſcribes correctories, with Aromaticks, for flowers of Antimony, leaſt they ſhould too vehemently provoke vomiting; where we in our Notes of the ſame flowers of Antimony, deſcribe circulation with noble Menstruums of Spirit of Wine and Honey, and afterward a ſimple digeſtion, by which they are rendred operative only by the inferior parts. Likewiſe flowers of Antimony by being wrought together for ſome time with common Salt, loſe their vomitive faculty.</hi>

                        <p>Moreover, if Pulveriſate glaſſe of Antimony, or flowers of the ſame, be infuſed in a Bolt-head, with Oyle or Spirit of Vitriol, not rectified (which muſt be well minded) the glade or flowers being covered two fingers with the Oyle or Spirit, and left for ſome time in a warm place, a dark red extraction is made. Of which, from four to ten drops, exhibited in ſome convenient liquor, purges the impurities of the belly by Siedge onely, without any detriment, nauſeouſneſs, or vomiting; it is a very profitable Cathartick, and in many diſeaſes admirably uſeful: yet it will be better, firſt to prove its virtue by experience, before it be too much commended.</p>

He rather judges, that in ſome the purging virtue, by digestion with Spirit of Wine, is impeded; but he leaves it ſo, as it ſeems, to require a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til arguing; for it doth not infringe the virtue, nor doth it attract it to it ſelf. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of purging Extracts, is foſtered in the volatile Mercurial-ſalt, wherefore it deſires a like</hi> Menſtruum; <hi>of like nature with that which ſhould be extracteds but Spirit of Wine is Sulphureous, and retains the nature of Sulphur; ſo that he attracts from things, what is of of his own nature,</hi> viz. <hi>Sulphur; leaving the Mercurial-ſalts untouched. Wherefore it is rather to be uſed for Extraction of ſuch things, whoſe eſſence conſiſts in Sulphur, ſuch are Diaphoreticks, than of Catharticks, for which it is not ſo proper. Yet this our judgment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overthrow the Opinion of thoſe, who endeavour to perſwade the contrary,</hi> viz. <hi>that no purging force is left in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> after they have been infuſed with Spirit of Wine; for, ſay, they, a certain Cathartick virtue may be extracted from Spirit of Wine, from which it is not eaſily ſeparated, but when it is about to be ſeparated the Spirit of Wine is alſo abſtracted with it. The contrary of this experience declares. For firſt, how can the Spirit of Wine attract to it ſelf, what is not of its own nature, as is already ſaid? Secondly, If it plainly extract the purging faculty, how is it, that when extracts of this kind, by this</hi> Mehſtruum <hi>debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (as they ſay) being afterward well dryed, and other convenient</hi> Menſtruum <hi>pour on, do ſtill retain their purging faculty ſo apparently manifeſt? And laſtly, where they ſay the Cathartick virtue, cannot eaſily be ſeparated from the Spirit of Wine, this alſo experience manifeſtly repugneſs For who will deny, that Spirit of Wine, uſed inſtead of a</hi> Menſtruum <hi>in Extract of</hi> Coloquintida, <hi>cannot eaſily be ſeparated from the purging Tincture? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the purging virtue is not fixed in Spirit of Wine: for the remaining</hi> Magna<hi>'s after Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine hath compleatly performed the office of Extraction, being afterward excited with other</hi> Menſtruums, <hi>do ſtill retain their purging faculty, by the Spirit of Wine not attracted. Yet rightly to prepare purging Extracts, except in Coloquintida, Scammony, and Elatery, whoſe violence by Spirit of Wine is corrected, other</hi> Menſtruums <hi>are more proper, ſuch as Metheglin. Canary Vine, Whey of Milk, Water of ſweet Apples, Betony, Fennel, Aniſe, Roſes, Meadon-ſweet, Cardu-bened, Fumitory and ſuch like; eſpecially, if with theſe be conjoyned ſome drops of Oyle of Tartar, made</hi> per deliquium, <hi>for ſo they will the ſooner attract, and take to themſelves the Mercurial Salt. From all which it is ſufficiently manifeſt, what is the cauſe in Extracts their purging property is debilitated, ſo as many times we are enforced to give ſome purges in the Subſtance. For which cauſe, this muſt well be noted and conſidered,</hi> viz. <hi>what</hi> Menſtruums <hi>are to be applyed to this or that Extract.</hi>

                        <p>A more compendious and leſs laborious way of preparing this Specifick, hath been by me invented, and often practiſed, which is, thus. ℞ Of ſpirit of Tartar diſtill'd, as the Author preſcribes below in Diaphoreticks, without any addition of ſpirit of Wine, 1 lib. Add to it of ſpirit of Wine 2 lib. and of rectified ſpirit of Vitriol ℥ij. Pour theſe when mixed, upon the <hi>Colcothar</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> (from which a Spirit hath been extracted, and is afterward calcined to a dark colour) and in a veſſel well cloſed, digeſt it in <hi>Balneo</hi> for certain days. Then diſtill it by Retort in an open fire, yet at firſt with exceeding gentle heat, leaſt the ſpirits which are very thin be exhaled and periſh: In the end urge the fire more ſtrongly. This diſtillation is ſcarcely finiſhed in three days. From the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> remaining after diſtillation, being firſt well and vehemently calcined in a Potter's Furnace, in the uſual manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a Salt, and with the before diſtill'd ſpirit, digeſt it in <hi>Balneo</hi> for fifteen days, then mix them with dry <hi>Argilla</hi> or the <hi>Pumex-ſtone</hi> calcined, and by an Earthen Retort in an open fire diſtill it; ſo with the Spirit the Salt will come forth made ſpirituous, and be mixed in the ſame liquor. This liquor, according to the Authors mind, by re-iterations cohobate, that is, diſtill it often, or elſe leave it to digeſt in <hi>Balneo,</hi> until the Salts begin to appear, ſpontaneouſly ſettling in the bottome, and then the deſired end of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51328:31"/>will be accompliſhed. By this means will be gained more, than half the time, which in the Author's preparation is conſumed; nor is this at all inferior to it, but, by reaſon it is more compendiouſly and leſs laboriouſly prepared, is rather more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
                        <p>Doſe and Uſe, as of the Authors.</p>

                              <hi>The</hi> Magiſtrale <hi>method of</hi> Arcanums <hi>and</hi> Vegetables.</head>
                           <p>There may alſo from the before recited Vegetables (neceſſary for uſe with <hi>Specificum purgans</hi>) as alſo from all others, ſubtill <hi>Arcanums</hi> be extracted; which indeed are not known to many, yet they are plainly Philoſophical; for all their virtues are intirely preſerved, whereas in other preparations not thus perfected they grow crude; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over theſe <hi>Arcanums</hi> are reduced into a liquor, grateful both to the Palate and Stomach, of which a very ſmall part, is of as great virtue, as other preparations far more largely exhibited. This method I commend to all my Diſciples, and as I ſincerely deliver it, ſo I deſire it may as faithfully be kept. From certain Herbs and Roots, but chiefly from them of which our Author makes mention, either all green, or ſome dryed, (for in one and the ſame time they cannot all be had) fermented a little and digeſted, extract a ſpirit and Phlegme; the ſpirit partly ſeparated from the phlegme keep a part, as alſo the phlegme.</p>
                           <p>From the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> calcined in the common manner, with the phlegme extract the Salts, by boiling it to a <hi>Lexivium,</hi> which Evaporated to a certain thickneſs like unto Oyle, joyn with its own ſpirit before reſerved, and mix it with three or four times ſo much <hi>Argilla</hi> or calcined <hi>Pumex;</hi> and by Retort, leiſurely augmenring the fire, diſtill it into a moſt large Receiver, in the bottome of which is firſt placed a moderate quantity of the ſame Vegetables mixt together, or one only, if the diſtillation be of one, (theſe muſt not be plainly dry, but ſomewhat withered, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elementary or accidental hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor muſt be only in part removed) the Spirit, together with the Salts made ſpirituous, will come forth, and falling upon the injected Vegetables, will calcine them, which will eaſily be diſcerned contracted in themſelves, and the liquor of a ruddy colour. The diſtillation ended, gather all which ſhall be in the Receiver, and by Retort in a cloſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatory diſtill it, and the liquor will come forth red, with ſome ſtink, this in all Vehicles may afterward be mixed, for it contains in it ſelf the whole faculty of all the mixture. Doſe ℈ j. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either by it ſelf, or in other appropriates. If the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificum purgans</hi> made of Vitriol and Tartar, as aboveſaid, with Eſſence of Saffron, be mixed in equal weight with liquor of this kind, or with that which is made from the Herbs our Author appoints, or elſe with any other prepared in the aforeſaid manner, provided they be appropriate and convenient, and the compoſition afterward given to the ſick, much more happily effects the Cure; and by this means the <note n="*" place="margin">Radical vices.</note>

                           <q>This adjection of Gold is by no means neceſſary or profitable, which is evinced by the following reaſon and experience. For the Gold is reduced to its priſtine body, therefore can by no means act, and ſo not render the Powder of Antimony more virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But if the Gold were from its corporeity, plainly reduced to a ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then indeed its addition would be very profitable. Yea, if Gold in a very ſmall quantity be added to this Bezoardick, it would encreaſe its virtue. If you would make <hi>Solar Bezoar,</hi> and looſe neither labour nor coſt, thus proceed. We ſay below, that in the firſt diſtillation, the Spirit of Nitre or <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> (which is the <hi>Menstruum</hi>) comes forth from that Butter in a moſt red tranſparent colour, and it afterward again comes off from the Water of its own Root, <hi>viz.</hi> it is conjoyned with the Antimony, by cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions often re-iterated.</q>

But experience, in elaboration of this Medicament, hath taught li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefaction, which the ſame <hi>Beguinus</hi> grants; this ought not to be metallick, but only ſo much may be added to the mixture, as ſhall be needful to make it flow like Salt. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, after the three calcinations with Nitre, it muſt always be waſhed with hot ſweet Water, and the Powder dryed, which will be very white. In which operation the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Tyrocinium</hi> and others acquieſs. But far more ſubtil is the Powder made, if after the laſt calcination, and ſome liquefaction the whole be beaten, and for certain hours boiled in Fountain Water, and the Decoction while it is hot filtred, and left in a cold place; for ſo by this boiling, that which is more ſubril is diſſolved in the Water, and at length precipited into an exceeding white and thin Powder, which muſt be often waſht and dryed. And if diſtill'd Vinegar be put into the ſame filtred Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Powder more eaſily and ſpeedily deſcends, and is of greater virtue. <hi>Baſilius Valentinus,</hi> in his Triumphant Chariot of Antimony, under the title of fixed Flowers of Antimony, or white Powder of Antimony (for ſo he and others call it) doth highly commend this for impoſthumes of the interior parts; fifteen granes of this being taken five times certain days together.

                        <p>For a third and fourth Diaphoretick, in ſtead of a Crown, I here add Tranſparent Gold, which is alſo barbarouſly called <hi>Perſpectable,</hi> and <hi>Panacea,</hi> compounded of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Antimony. The former is tranſlucid glaſs of Antimony, with which in melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gold is mixt, from which mixtion and tranſparency it takes its name. The prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is after this manner:</p>
                        <p>℞ Of moſt pure Gold ℥ſs. Ungarick Antimony ℥viij. put them together in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble placed in the fire, when in Flux pour it out, yet beware it be not converted to a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus.</hi> This mixture grinde exceeding well, that it may be a moſt ſubtil Powder, which calcine (after the ſame manner, as Antimony is calcined when prepared into glaſs) untill it yeild no more fume. When you have the Powder thus fixed, ſet on the Fire a Pot, that it may be very hot, and be as it were reduced to glaſs; afterward pour the Powder into it leiſurely, while it is ſo very hot, and let it flow ſo long, as till it be plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to a red tranſparent glaſs, which you may prove with an Iron Rod; and you will find the Gold in the bottom of the Crucible half diminiſhed. Pour it out into a Baſon, and you will have the Tranſparent Gold with glaſs of Antimony in equal weight mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. ℞ Of this Tranſparent Gold Pulveritate what quantity you pleaſe, upon it pour Spirit of good Wine very well rectified, till it be covered four fingers, the veſſel being very well cloſed, ſet it in digeſtive heat, and the Spirit from the Gold will extract a moſt red Tincture, which keep for uſe. Of this Spirit from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. or more exhibited, provokes Sweat, cleanſes the blood from all impurities, and Tartarous ſeculencies, the reſolved Salt of the Microcoſm, from whence the Dropſy proceeds, it coagulates, and exterminates noxious phlegms from out of the Body. It helps ſuch as are afflicted with the Gout, delivers both from the pain and diſeaſe, eſpecially if taken with <hi>Arcanum</hi> of Flints, of which below in the <hi>Podagrical Specifick.</hi> Dolours of <hi>Lues vencrea,</hi> in the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſtium</hi> of the Arms and Legs it wonderfully remove; moreover in the cure of <hi>Lues,</hi> eſpecially in delicate perſons, it is very profitably uſed in changeable decoctions, as of <hi>China, Sarſaparilla,</hi> and <hi>Guaiacum.</hi> It cures Ulcers.

The moſt common Solution of Pearls is with Vinegar, <hi>viz.</hi> if the proceſs be ſo made, as the Author appoints. Some prepare Vinegar thus: From Aſhes of the knotty Herb <hi>Kalt</hi> 1 lib. (from which are made <hi>Lixiviums</hi> and Sopes, alſo <hi>Glaſiers</hi> uſe them to puriſy their glaſs) with the beſt diſtill'd Vinegar vj lib. very leiſurely poured on the Aſhes, to prevent the danger of over-much heat, they diſtill it by thrice cohobating; whereby the Vinegar is made ſweet, and hardly at all biting; yet of exceeding virtue in diſſolving Corals and Pearls.</p>
                           <p>Moreover from that Solution of Corals and Pearls with diſtill'd Vinegar, are made Magiſteries of the ſame; of which ſee <hi>Tyrocinium Chymicum,</hi> &amp;c. with my Notes <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 19.</p>

                        <p>Salt and Magiſtery of Pearls in Medicine are exceeding profitable, yet more excellent is their Quinteſſence, which is the more interior, and more pure Juice or Liquor by many Solutions, and digeſtions diligently from them extracted.

But in ſome part, the Deſcription is Imperfect, the following is more exact. A choice quantity of Pearls muſt be diſſolved in Spirit of Wine-vinegar, and this not otherwiſe performed, than is deſcribed by the Author, <hi>viz.</hi> by diſtillation remove the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and again diſſolve the Salt of Pearls in freſh diſtill'd Vinegar, and removing the feces abſtract again by diſtillation the ſame <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> this operation of Solution with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vinegar and Coagulation, (always rejecting the feces) muſt be continued, until no more feces, after the laſt Solutions, do at all remain, and ſo the Pearls will be freed from all impurity. Then with Rain-water, or <hi>May-dew,</hi> the purified Salt of Pearls muſt be diſſolved, and this watery <hi>Menſtruum</hi> often removed, the Spirits of the Vinegar remaining with the Pearls, by diſtillation in Aſhes muſt be drawn off, when the watery <hi>Menſtruum</hi> remains ſweet, after abſtraction it is a ſign the Spirits of the Vinegar are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. To this moſt pure Salt of Pearls in a Phiol, pour on rectified <hi>Alcohol</hi> of Wine, till it be covered two fingers, the glaſs well cloſed ſet to digeſt in <hi>Balneo</hi> for eight or ten days, in which time the Pearls will ſend forth their Eſſence, upon the Superficies of the Spirit of Wine like to thick Oyle, which warily ſeparate; pour on other <hi>Alcohol</hi> of Wine allowing the like ſpace of time for digeſtion, gather the Eſſence, this do, till no more Eſſence appear to riſe, and the whole Salt, leaving very few feces, be converted into an Eſſence. This again with Spirit of Wine circulate for ſome time, afterward ſeparate the Spirit by gentle heat in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and keep the Eſſence.

                        <p>Firſt, Diſſolve Corals in moſt ſtrong Vinegar, as our Author teacheth, the <hi>Menstruum</hi> removed by diſtillation, gather their Salt. This Salt afterward muſt be ſo long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with diſtill'd Vinegar, as till no more of the ſaid Spirit can at all be received into the Salt. Which being done, thus proceed: To every pound of Salt of Corals, add the firſt time of moſt ſharp diſtill'd Vinegar ℥ij. then gently diſtill it, and the unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury phlegm only will come off. The ſecond time add ℥iij. of the former Vinegar, and again gently diſtill it; ſo go on every time adding of the Vinegar, and encreaſing ℥j. and diſtill it until the Vinegar come forth as ſharp, as when firſt poured on. See <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocinium chap.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. of Quinteſſence of Corals; yet the Proceſs of <hi>Beguinus</hi> is not perfect.</p>

This Spirit hath a good odour, and burns like Spirit of Wine, which muſt afterward by Retort be rectified with the remaining red Oyle. This noble <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> produced partly from the Vinegar, and partly from the Corals themſelves, extracts a moſt red Tincture, from freſh Corals poured into it; which, if afterward freed from the Spirit by diſtillation, and then conjoyned either with other cordial and appropriate Water, or cohobated with them till it be rendred volatile, is a moſt excellent Tincture of Corals, of moſt pleaſant taſte, and delectable odour.</p>

                        <p>There is another Tincture more excellent than the former, although that <hi>Menſtruum</hi> extracts a Tincture from the Corals, yet it may be judged to be rather from the diſtill'd Vinegar; than the Corals themſelves: This way, becauſe not ſincere, cannot be very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the ingenious, therefore another way is found out whereby the Tincture may elegantly be extracted from the Corals; which is thus: Firſt, Calcine the Corals whole, not pulveriſate, in a fire of Reverberation, at firſt gentle, ſo as the live flame may but juſt touch the Superficies of the Teſts (<hi>viz</hi> Iron <note n="*" place="margin">Pots.</note> Diſhes) placed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatory Furnace, in which the Corals are put. By this means in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51328:44"/>of fire the Corals will wax white, abſconding their native colour: therefore the fire muſt be gradually encreaſed, till from their whiteneſs, they be converted to a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from the yellowneſs reduced to a perfect red, the whole ſubſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals being rendred ſpongeous and light: This operation for the moſt part is finiſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

When the Corals are thus made red, by the benefit of degrees of fire, they are rendred fit to depoſe their proper Tincture into an other <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> If therefore theſe Corals thus prepared be injected into Spirit of Wine, or <hi>Alcohol</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>May-dew,</hi> they a little after into that ſame <hi>Alcohol</hi> ſpontaneouſly ſend forth their Tincture, their feces remaining in the bottom without any virtue.

                              <hi>is reduced into an oyly Liquor; yet with it is conjoyned the Spirit of</hi> Aqua fortis, <hi>therefore it is not true Oyle. Now when this Liquor is mixed with other fat Oyles, there is a mutual ebullition, which is not otherwiſe occaſioned, but from the Saline Spirits of the</hi> Aqua fortis, <hi>otherwiſe in like manner with other Oyles ſighting, by reaſon of their contrary nature. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by little or nothing of the Gold is diſſolved with them, or if any be, it is not done by any of the Oyles; but meerly from the Corroſive Spirits themſelves, being heated by the working toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Oyles. Moreover the ſame Oyles, without any Calx of Gold, of themſelves, being confuſedly mixt, in the manner we have already ſaid, will become thick and red; therefore this redneſs is from themſelves, and not from the Gold.

                        <head>Confortative Balſomes (a) thickned by the benefit of Wax.</head>
                        <p>Becauſe Aromatick Oyles in a liquid form, for danger of ſpilling or breaking the glaſs, cannot be conveniently or commodiouſly carried; Chymiſts began to conſider of a way of thicking them, ſo as divers of them, in boxes of Tin or Silver, well gilt, may the more commodiouſly be carried about, and be always ready at hand in urgent neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>To prepare theſe the way denoted by the ingenious is ſufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> that to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of any of theſe <hi>Balſomes,</hi> there is required as much Oyle by diſtillation drawn forth, as Tincture extracted by Alcoholiſate Spirit of Wine, and thickned by ſeparation from the ſame Spirit: Alſo the Salt by the benefit of Water after calcining extracted, a Medium, which gives a juſt conſiſtency to theſe, is white wax ſhaved, and often boiled in Roſe-water, that its Acrimony may be taken away that thereby no ſtrange quality of ſavour may be inferr'd.</p>
                        <p>All theſe, if mixed by a true and Chymical Artificer, Odoriferous Balſoms of Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and Vegetables, may be thereby rightly prepared, as well for external, by anointing the Noſtrils and Temples, as for internal uſe, being according to the uſe and propriety of Simples moſt efficacious.</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi>Confortative Balſoms are no other than Aromatick Oyles compounded, and by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other things, which are as it were Baſes, are made more thick, and ſo may the better be carried about and retained. Moreover, to the Compoſition of theſe Balſomes, whether a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain weight of Principles, ought, or poſſibly can be obſerved in all, is much to be queſtioned. We deny it. For ſome are more dry, and plainly have a dry Tincture, ſuch is Cinnamon; ſome have most oyly Tinctures, as Nutmegs, Mace, Fennel, Aniſe, Cloves; ſome obtain a middle Nature, as Ginger. Therefore as their Natures are more dry or moiſt, ſo alſo varies the Oyle in weight. But in general, ſo much of the conſisting Baſis muſt be mixed with the Oyle, as may ſuffice to coagulate it, which afterward with the Tincture may the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>HUmane nature is delighted with Odours, and the Spirits thereby greatry refreſhed. Therefore <hi>Philagrius</hi> on <hi>Aetius,</hi> not improperly ſaith; that Nature is willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with delectable Odours, and ſo recreated thereby, and as it were revived, that ſhe recovers her wonted vigour, before oppreſt by the fierceneſs of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>For the Odour, drawn by the Noſtrils, is conveighed to the Heart and Brain, and by it the compreſt and ſuffocated Spirit is excited, and its further decay apparently hindred. Yea, there are hot Regions, whereas <hi>Pliny (a)</hi> notes, a certain People live by Odours only. With reſpect to health, the Air is of very great moment, for whoſoever ſickens by the infection of evil Odour, <hi>(b)</hi> is difficultly cured, becauſe the ingrateful Odour, with the Spirit, ſubtilly penetrates all parts of the Body, eſpecially the Brain and Breaſt. With the Odour of <hi>Elixir</hi> of Life, compounded of various Aromaticks, <hi>Baptista (c) Porta</hi> ſaith, that he hath by manifold experience found, the expiring ſpirit of many to be retained: for the principal Members and vital Spirits, (which by every kind of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome are firſt of all moleſted and infected) are wonderfully refreſhed by Aromatick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmells, and the venomous Fumes excluded. It is needful the Spirit, with Spirit <hi>(d)</hi> and Odour, be recreated and reſtored. There are ſweet Odours agreeable, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to our Spirits, the only Authors of Humane Life. We ſee, that to ungrateful Odours, we ſtop our Noſtrils, and hold our Breath, that we may not receive the Stinkes, which we no ſooner perceivably retain, but we are debilitated. When by theſe our ſpirits with Swounings or Convulſions are oppreſt and dejected, as ſoon as we are again ſenſible of ſweet Odours, we are immediatly elevated and refreſht. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we know the Mouth of the Matrix is turned upward and downward, according to the motion of a pleaſing ſmell: So not only in the Peſt, but alſo in Ungarick Fevers, and ſuch like venemous diſeaſes, the Spirits, which by attracting the Contagion, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and contaminated, may (and alſo ought to) be amended and reſtored with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes; as may be ſeen in <hi>Conradinus</hi> his Book of the Ungarick Fever, wherein he deſcribes Candles, and various odoriferous Waters.</p>
                     <p>In preparing this odoriferous Specifick, which by the flagrancy of its Odour, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful forcible in reſtoring the deficiency of the Vitals, who ſo would follow the proceſs of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his <hi>Archidoxes, (e)</hi> in preparing it by digeſtion, he may with me looſe both labour and coſt.

                           <p>As Civet by its own Odour expels ordure; ſo this Odoriferous Specifick ejects di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes from the ſick. And as <hi>Tirus</hi> is mixed in compoſition of Treacle, that it may cauſe the virtue of the other Ingredients to penetrate the principal Members; ſo alſo here for greater penetration <hi>Carbos</hi> is added, whoſe prevalent ingrateful Odour (yet by digeſtion, as by Experience I have found, it is tranſmuted into a moſt ſweet and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſmell) doth far ſooner penetrate, than all operations of Lillyes, as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> truly denotes.</p>
                           <p>This Odoriferous Specifick is of principal Uſe, when Medicaments, cannot be taken into the Body, as in the <hi>Apoplexy</hi> and <hi>Epilepſy.</hi> For many with ſuch Odours are helped, and exceedingly refreſht, not that the Diſeaſe is plainly taken away or cured, but the way for the cure is prepared; becauſe by the virtue of this Odour, communicated to the Body, the Blood is moved, and the Heart above meaſure comforted.</p>
                           <p>In Apoplexy, Epilepſy, Cholick, Suffocation of the Matrix.</p>

                           <p>In comforting <hi>Venus (m)</hi> Men may alſo uſe it.</p>
                           <p>It may be mixed with a little expreſt Oyle of Nutmegs, that it be like an Oyntment, and ſo in the above named Diſeaſes may the more commodiouſly be uſed.</p>

                              <p>It may deſervedly be called the moſt efficacious <hi>European Opobalſamum,</hi> becauſe by its own faculty it exceeds all other Remedies in curing the Apoplexy and Epilepſy. It was once called Sacred, by reaſon of its occult and admirable virtues.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. In the Peſt, one drop morning and evening chafed about the Noſtrils, prevents from venemous Infection. It is ſometimet given from ℈ j, to ℈ij. in Water of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus-bened.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. It is exceeding profitable to ſuch as are in danger to be afflicted with dangerous diſeaſes of the Head, as the Apoplexy, Paralyſy, and Epilepſy.

A like efficacious are Tablets of <hi>Rotula</hi>'s made of Sugar, and mixt with ſome drops of this Oyle. And for any one that is already infeſted with the Apoplexy, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſy, or Paralyſy, there is not a more excellent Remedy, than ſome drops of diſtill'd Oyle of white Amber, infuſed in Epileptick <hi>(e)</hi> Spirit and exhibited. It is alſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anoint the Neck and Noſtrils with the ſaid Oyle, and certainly the diſeaſe will be expell'd thereby, and the diſeaſed ſpeedily recover ſence and motion; in like manner a perſume of the ſame white Amber, ſprinkled upon burning coals, and conveighed to the Noſtrils of the Epileptick in the time of the fit, very much abates it.</p>

                        <p>It is the principal part of a Phyſician, that would Cure the Sick, firſt to comfort the Heart, and afterward aſſault the Diſeaſe. Thoſe to whom the harmonious Analogy of Superiours and Inferiours hath been known, and who from ſuffrages of Aſtrologers have learned that to the two greateſt Lights of Heaven, the two principal parts of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart and Brain, are attributed, cannot deny, that the greateſt Confortative of the Heart, in things of Nature, latently reſts in <hi>GOLD,</hi> ſealed with ſeven Seals, <hi>(a)</hi> as in the foregoing <note n="*" place="margin">

                           </note> Preface is ſufficiently denoted. Vulgar Phyſicians confeſs Gold comforts the Heart, which is nor to be underſtood of common dead Gold, by its Aſpect only to exhilarate the Heart, but of the Phyloſophick living Gold, regenerate, and more than perfect, reſolvible in every Liquor. Although ſome Gems are preferred before Gold, yet it is not becauſe they are better than it, but that they are more rare, and found in far ſmaller quantity. For, Nature hath endowed Gold, with no contemptible virtues, which, who ſo knows how to draw out, and by ingenions Artifice is able rightly to uſe, he will find Gold, which ſeemed dead and barren, to be ſo lively and pregnant, that it germi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, and of it ſelf progenerates new Gold, with new and infinite en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the generation of Metals is not ſo obvious to the Sight, as of Vegetables and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the reaſon is, that groſs Terreſtinal Mole, by which the Vegetative Spirit, lock't up as it were in a Caſtle is impeded, whereby it is leſs able to perform its office of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enrating its like. If this by Art can be freed from that Terreſtial Houſe and Sepulcher, and looſened from all its impurities; without doubt, as all other creatures, it will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly participate of the generative virtue, and bring forth fruit according to its ſeed, and ſo Metal will bring forth Metal, and Gold generate Gold.</p>
                        <p>Whence, the true Philoſophers have exquiſitely prepared a wonderful, and greatly to be deſired Medicine, with which the impurities of imperfect Metals are removed, and

The Example of this we have in corporeal or vulgar Gold, which indeed can never be rendred Philoſophically potable, unleſs by this only univerſal <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> the Gold be reduced to a corroborating faculty. Firſt, A moſt ſubtil Calx may be made, and that indeed in the ſame manner our Author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes.

Afterward add freſh <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and in a dry <hi>Balneo,</hi> by Retort urge it more ſtrongly, and together with it, the Calx of <hi>Sol</hi> will come forth, leaving very few Feces. That which is come forth, in a Pelican, or other Glaſs hermetically cloſed, digeſt in gentle heat of the Sun, or a Hot-houſe, until the Gold be Philoſophically reſolved, and from the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> it ſelf, reſide in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel, and be ſpontaneouſly ſeparated, both from the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and all waterineſs which from the Gold warily removed, dry the Calx very gently, for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding volatile. Being dryed, put it in a proportionable Phiol, that is, ſuch an one, whoſe fourth part only may be filled with the Calx, this Hermetically ſealed, place in a moſt kindly and gentle heat of Aſhes for fourteen days, prudently taking head, leaſt the Calx of Gold by vehemency of heat aſcend, and be ſublimed. Afterward place it in Sand, and keep equal degrees of fire for eight days, till the Gold, like a Bery obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly red, be at length made moſt fixt. Of this ℞ ℥j. grind it exceeding ſmall, pour upon it of moſt pure Spirit of Wine <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. diſſolve it in gentle heat, and keep it.

                           <head>Flowers of Sulphur.</head>
                           <p>The uſe of Crude Sulphur in Medicine ought not to be admitted, unleſs that may be had, which is found in Mines, and is called <hi>Sciſſile (a),</hi> by nature purified, which with Flowers of Sulphur, prepared by Art, is of equal virtue. For as here by artificial, ſo there by natural fire, the more pure part of the Sulphur is elevated to higher places, and ſo muſt needs by reaſon be judged better digeſted; therefore when <hi>Sciſſile</hi> is at hand it may be uſed inſtead of the Flowers: But becauſe nature ſeldome ſupplies us with aboundance of <hi>Sciſſile,</hi> Chymical Phyſicians began to think of an Artifice, whereby in defect thereof, they might be ſupplied.</p>
                           <p>In the Fields of <hi>Cracovia (b)</hi> in <hi>Polonia,</hi> it is found cleanſed with wonderful Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Nature; and once with deſire I ſaw it in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> near the Sulphurous Pits, where the Sulphurous Mountain perpetually burns. The Sulphur in that place, is wont to ſweat out of the Stones like Dew; that flower is moſt ſweet, of which, if a true Spagirick Artificer could have aboundance, from it he might draw a Magiſterial Chymical Medicament. The Sulphur that is there made, may afterward by the force of fire, be throughly purged from the Stones and Earth <hi>(c).</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Near <hi>Salisburge,</hi> in the Copper-mines, where they boile Vitriol, from the <hi>Minera,</hi> by Aſſation, as they call it, the Sulphur is wont to fly from the <hi>Minera,</hi> which afterward ſticks in the Chimney like fine flower, which Chimney is therefore ſtudiouſly built to receive and retain that fume. This Flower of Sulphur is well purified, and being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed from the <hi>Minera</hi> of Vitriol, it retains in it ſelf a certain ſharpneſs.</p>
                           <p>Therefore this, in defect of flowers Chymically prepared, may very commodiouſly be uſed, as I have often found by Experience.</p>
                           <p>℞ Of moſt yellow Sulphur (for that which is of a red colour, hath much of Arſenick, <hi>(d)</hi> Realgar in it, and for Medicine ought not to be uſed) one pound, Salt-fuſe half a pound; make the Salt firſt flow in a Crucible, then pour it out, and cool it upon a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel or in a Mortar of Ungarick Vitriol purified, and calcined half a pound pulveriſate, and mix theſe together, put them in a glaſs Cucurbit, (with a convenient Neck not too capacious) with <hi>Argilla</hi> beaten very ſmall, put on a high and large Alembeck, with a Recipient annexed, place it in Aſhes or Sand, yet take heed it be not encompaſſed too high with Sand, leaſt the ſuperior part waxing hot cauſe the flowers to melt, and when you ſuffer it to cool, you will difficultly take off the Alembeck, unleſs with a live coal you melt the congealed matter. If the Head be well fitted, it need not be Luted, if
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51328:73"/>you will you may paſte a little paper round about. Theſe things thus performed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diſtill at firſt with gentle fire, after three hours the Phlegme will begin to come forth, and ſo continue four or five hours. The fire muſt be gradually encreaſed with great coals, that the veſſel <hi>(e)</hi> wherein the Sand is contained may be red hot, If the fire be continued, ſo as the Sulphur in the Alembeck ſeem to flow, then it will quickly be Sublimed; yet the fire muſt not be exceſſive, for ſo it will not aſcend of a yellow colour, but black.</p>
                           <p>The flowers elevated in the Alembeck, may ſoon be taken out, if round about paper be held, while the Alembeck is lifted up, to prevent the flowers falling into the Sand, if at the ſame time the Cucurbit be very hot; without delay cover the Orifice thereof, leaſt the Sulphur by the ingreſs of Air, as is often wont, be fired. The flowers taken out of the Alembeck put it on again, and continue the fire ten hours.</p>
                           <p>After the ſublimation is ended, when all are cooled, and the Alembeck removed, take out the flowers, and mix them with the former. The <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> in every ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, will be porous and light, being ſprinkled upon hot coals, it will not at all burn, which is a ſign it is deprived of all virtue.</p>
                           <p>Theſe flowers mix with new Salt, and Vitriol, obſerving the former proportion, and proceed in ſublimation altogether, as the firſt time, which the oftner it is done, the more ſubtil will the flowers be, and be made more and more pure. The third time do in like manner, yet you will have fewer flowers, for from three pound thrice ſublimate, you will have but ℥xx. In this third Repetition it will be expedient to deſiſt, not only becauſe it is much deminiſhed, but becauſe the profitable parts of Sulphur are apt to fix themſelves.</p>
                           <p>One half of theſe Flowers, mixed with the following Gums, reduced to moſt fire powder, keep for uſe, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> (f) adviſeth, <hi>in lib. Paragraph. &amp; lib. de Nature. in lib. &amp; cap.</hi> of Sulphur.</p>

                           <p>(l) <hi>Purging Specificks in the Droſie are very many. The most excellent of which we ſhall here rehearſe. Our Author above, among the virtues of precipitate Mercury, attributes to it this, that in the Dropſie it is an Appropriate Remedy, having in it ſelf a property of expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whey-like humor, which is undoubtedly true; and moreover in this Hydropick Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, he joyns it with the Extract of black Hellebore and Colequintida, that their virtues may be rendred more ſtrong in expelling, and alſo the doſes of precipitate Mercury, for their more commodious exhibiting he appoints to be made up in Pills. Therefore this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate Mercury, is by him highly praiſed and commended, and not without cauſe, for it pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully helps in this caſe. Of like virtue is</hi> Mercurius vitae, <hi>or Flowers of Butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of which above, if from four granes to twelve thereof, be exhibited for three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in extract of Hellebore and Colequintida; they happily expell the reſolved Salt. But afterward Sweats and Wrine muſt be provoked, with a decoction of</hi> Sarſaparilla, Lignum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, <hi>or root of Colts-foot, adding always a little Spirit of Tartar, or other Diaphoreticks and Diureticks, of which above; but eſpecially adding</hi> Arcanum <hi>of</hi> Wormwood, <hi>or</hi> Carduus Benedictus. <hi>But this is to be noted, that the exhibiting of</hi> Mercurius vitae <hi>three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in thoſe of ripe age, is often wont to cauſe the falling down of the Fundament, which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rarely, or at moſt very difficultly cured. Yet it is neaful in cure of the Dropſie, that ſuch Purgations be adhibited in the beginning, but afterward Diureticks and Hydroticks muſt ſucceed. For otherwiſe,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>this will happen, the Whey, or Watery humidity will all be devolved to the Reins Urinal Paſſages, from whence afterward, by reaſon of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, very often moſt pertinacious Symptomes are wont to ariſe. Moreover in preparation of the Extract of Root of black Hellebore, it will be more ſafe instead of Spirit of Wine, to take Wine it ſelf, with which the Root muſt only be gently Boiled without noiſe, and this done with freſh Wine, ſo long as until all the Eſſencified force be Extracted from the Root, afterward by evaporating or distilling reduce the Extract to the thickneſs of Honey. For Spirit of Wine, by reaſon of its attraction, which it rather acts upon the Sulphur, then the Mercurial liquor, in which the purging virtue conſiſts, is leſs profitable, therefore Wine is better.</hi>

Then of theſe Aſhes, with common or proper Water, draw forth a Salt, by Diſtilling the Extractions to a skinnineſs, and afterward ſetting them in a cold place to Cryſtallize. As much Sulphur as Aſhes muſt be taken. Theſe Salts are beſt of all, and do wonderfully operate, nor do they taſte at all like <hi>Lixivium.</hi> So Salt of Wormewood, in this manner prepared, purges the impurities of the Ventricle, and Breaſt by Vomiting; if ℈ j <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. thereof be Exhibited in ℥ij. of Water. Salt of Imperatory, made the ſame way from the Roots, Exhibited from four granes to eight in Juice of Elder-berries, takes away all Fevers.</p>

In Wounds of every kind, the feathery ſoft down that grows about the Seed of Carduus-bened, or in the Poplar-tree, moiſtned in the Balſom blood-warm, and put into the Wound, firſt waſhed with Wine afterward the following Stictick-plaiſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and kept on, until neither Veins. Arteries, For Nerves, nor the mark of the Swathing, nor any thing of that kind appear.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. In all Tumors, Inflammations, Contracted, and bruiſed Members, in Ruptures of Bones.</p>

                              <p>It is a moſt efficacious Balſome in healing Wounds and Pricks.</p>
                              <p>(a) <hi>There are three genuine, and artifical ways, whereby conſolidation of all Wounds, may be rightly, and duely performed. The firſt is of Balſoms. The ſecond of Stictick Playſters. The third of Vulnerary Potions. Of the two former, and indeed very well our Author appoints. But of Vulnerary Potions we ſhall add ſome thing. Vulnerary Balſomes there are many prepared; yet this is to be obſerved, that thoſe balſoms which are made by diſtillation, are leſs fit, by reaſon of their too much penetration, and the</hi> Empyreuma, <hi>which for the most part they contract by distillation. In preparing Balſome of St. Johnswort this method may be obſerved.</hi>

                           <p>℞ All the aforeſaid Flowers dry, or dry them with the Roots of the greater Comphrey, and round Ariſtolochy; afterward add the other Species, and boil them in Wine until it wax red; expreſs it, and then boil them in Wine with Oyle Olive and Turpentine, till it be conſumed; ſtrain the Oyle through a Linnen Cloth, and keep it. It is almoſt of equal virtue with the former, unleſs the former by the

                           <p>The fetid Oyle of Cinnamon as I have aboveſaid, by uſe is found to be a famous Vulnerary Balſome, it is not its diſtillation, but its inſited thickneſs, and propriety, that obtains this faculty of conſolidating.</p>
                           <p>Oyle of Walnuts made by Expreſſion, and afterward by Boiling, reduced to a Liquid Subſtance, is highly commended in this caſe.</p>

                           <p>In preparing theſe, I obſerve the following method.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The five <hi>(h)</hi> Gums macerated in Vinegar, and boiled, are expreſt through a thick Linnen cloth, the boiling is twice repeated (the Doſe of the Gums may be encreaſed, by reaſon of the Feces remaining after expreſſion, which are thrown away) afterward over a gentle heat, in a clean pan <hi>(i)</hi> they are thickned to a convenient conſiſtency.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Oyles of Linum and Olives, are put into another Pan, and the Lithargy of gold and ſilver is added, they are boiled and ſtirr'd together, till the Oyle be coloured afterward the Calaminaris is added, and a little after the Minium, all theſe kept conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtirring are boiled for almoſt two hours together, till they be boiled enough, which is proved, if a drop being put upon your Nail condenſe and harden, and will no more diſſolve.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Then alſo about the end add the Vernix, Oyle of Bays, Wax, and Colophony, all being well mixt, and melted, and removed from the fire, make the Pan with the Gums leiſurely to heat, and ſucceſſively pour out the Liquor from the ſecond Pan to the Gums, by moſt diligent ſtirring incorporate them over moſt gentle heat; beware the mixture boil not (for ſo the Gums will be clotted, and difficulty mixed with the Oyle) afterward in ſtirring add the powders, and diligently work all together for an hour; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, add the Camphir, firſt diſſolved in Oyle of Juniper <hi>(k):</hi> If it happen to be too ſoft, a little more Wax and Colophony may be added.</p>
                           <p>The way to try its juſt conſiſtency is thus: Dip a ſtick into it while it is hot, and let ſome drops fall into Water, if the matter be ſoft, and ſtick to your fingers, boil it long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, till it be hard. Then take it from the fire, and pour it into a large Baſon full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with your hands (firſt anointed with Oyle of Camomil, Roſes, Juniper, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, and St. Johnswort, of each a like quantity mixt) knead and work it very well for three or four hours, that it may be like an Amalgama; make it up in Rolls, which wrap in Leather <hi>(l),</hi> and keep for uſe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is greatly to be deſired, That the <hi>Herbariſts</hi> of our time, who are ignorant of the Internal Form, knowing only the Matter, Subſtance, and Corporiety of Herbs, would imploy as great diligence in enquiring into the Signatures of Plants, as they are aocurate in various, and often very frivolous debates about their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; hereby far more abundant and fruitful uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would redound to the Weal-publique of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.

Although from the Nonuments of others, without any Foundation of Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſeparation of the true from the falſe, very many Heteroclite Vertues are deſcribed, and aſſigned to ſeveral Herbs; yet Experience, the alone and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſtris of things, teſtifies that they are inſuſſicient to anſwer the deſired expectation of Phyſitians and Patients. If Experience, the Mother of Verity, may be credited, we need not infer many reaſons for the proof hereof. There is required a higher ingenuity, and more ſubtile Inquiſition, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Divers and maniſold ſormes are the Signes directing to find every ſingular Myſtery.</hi>
                     </note> then can be obtained by ſight of the Eyes only. If the plenary and intimate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Plants (ſuch as Nature hath reſerved to be ſearched out, and ſubtilly underſtood by the ſtudious lovers and admirers of Natural things) we would as perfectly comprehend, as ſome hundreds of them, at firſt ſight, without the knowledge of their Internal Vertue, may in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar manner, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The qualities of</hi> Simples <hi>are not to be conſidered; but their</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canums.</note> by their Names be diſcerned: Yet names of Herbs have not the vertues, therefore their Bodies are to be examined, that we may know, what purges, what yields odour, what heals feavers, and what cures wounds. Moreover, that fallacious and unjuſt cenſure of the Four Qualities, viz. <hi>Hot, Cold, Dry,</hi> and <hi>Moiſt,</hi> cannot ſufficiently manifeſt their Vertues, ſuch qualities being but the Shadows of things, as Colours, not having roots, or powerful operations. They will not run this hazard, who knowing the Vertue from the root of the Center, not from the Superficies; and, leaving the ſubtilty of fruitleſs names, do from things themſelves, by intimate and profound ſpeculation, more exquiſitely ſearch out the Truth. In things oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult conſider the manifeſt foot steps of Nature divinely impreſt, and diligently enquire after the hidden dowryes of Herbs, by inſpecting their external Form, and by taſte perceiveing what the difference is between the ſhell, and the Kernel, between the Houſe and the Inhabitant, unleſs unadviſedly to Wood and Stones, they give the denomination of true repreſentations, or leaving Colonies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Corporation with disjoyned Cottages. In all external things the exterior Caſe is only the Receptacle of innate and inherent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, infuſed by God, as the Soul into the humane Body. That <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> moſt rightly ſought to underſtand the Ingenuity and Knowledge of the Interiour Man, not by the name, but by expreſſions, (which are true characters and indications of the mind, and internal faculties,) who whilest a Youth ſtood mute before him, thus compelled him; <hi>Speak, O thou Young Man, if thou meaneſt I ſhall know thee.</hi> Indeed, by the interpretation of the voice, the Arcanums <hi>of the Mind are opened. In like manner, Herbs Magically by their Signature beſpeak the <hi>Phyſitian's</hi> thorow Introſpection, and to him by Similitude
<pb facs="tcp:51328:103"/>Manifeſt their Interiours, concealed in the occult Silence of Nature. For there is (according to the words of the most excellent <hi>Baptiſta Porta</hi>) a way of demonſtrating by ſimilitude, wherein very often the chief Artificer is wont to manifeſt divine and occult things, according to the ſupream ſimilitude of <hi>Idea's;</hi> nor could he do theſe in a more excellent or admirable way. If we feign that Plants do ſpeak, and be willing to manifest their ſecret commodities wherein they excel, howſoever they expreſs themſelves, and in what manner ſoever they are about to ſpeak, their Language is not perceived by all, like as the Speech, and Characters of writing, to ſeveral Nations, are proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar; whence it is needful, that either all be of one Nation, or all be able to ſpeak infinite Languages, if all ſhould alike underſtand; which by Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not permitted. So the exquiſite Artifice of Nature in her ſimilitudes of things, though hriefly, and ſufficiently perſpicuous to all, yet is perceived only by few. All Herbs, Flowers, Trees, and other things which proceed out of the Earth, are Books, and Magick Signes, communicated to us, by the immenſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, which Signes are our Medicine. But that by their Knowledge we may come to the true and appointed Medicine, I ſhall offer ſomewhat to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous. Whoſo deſireth to be an expert Phyſitian, and to have knowledge of thoſe things which point to Medicine, by that Art, which Nature externally propoſeth by Signes, he may understand what thoſe internally ſignifie: for every thing that is intrinſecal, bares the external figure of its occult property, us well in inſenſible as ſenſible Creatures. Nature as it were by certain ſilent notes ſpeaks to us, and reveals the ingenuity and manners of every Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; As is aptly declared in that Metaphorick ſaying of <hi>Adamantius Polemon,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Man is ſaid to enter, or aſcend, when by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, he is lifted up from the loweſt to the higheſt; aſcending from Senſibles to Intellectuals, from Creatures to the Creator himſelf. The <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, there are Fifty Gates of Intelligencies; they are degrees or limits of all things gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> by which, as by <hi>Symbols,</hi> or Notes, we are led to the knowledge of all things Viſible, and Inviſible. But a man is ſaid to go out, or deſcend, when he turnes from GOD to the Creatures, from Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals to external Formes, from the Centre to the Circumference. <hi>As for
<pb facs="tcp:51328:107"/>Example</hi> with my ſenſual Eye, I behold this Kernel of an Apple, but leaving the Corporiety, I turn my ſelf from the External Form, to the Internal Inviſible Seed, and with the Eye of my Mind I contemplate the whole Tree, with the Root, Trunck, Bowes Sprigs, Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit, compriſed in One, and in due time manifeſted to have received its proper Body; but this Seed takes nothing of thoſe Corporals from without, but of it ſelf from its own Penetrales ſends forth all of them gradually. When therefore the <hi>Aſtrum,</hi> or ſeed of this kind, is the Image or ſhadow of the Angelick Subſtance, and it comprehends in its inmoſt parts, the whole Corporeal Mole of the Tree, without quantity, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly, One Angel will compriſe the Seeds of all things Spiritually in themſelves, much more eaſily, excellently, higher, and better then Nature; for by how much the more ſimple, by ſo much the more perfect, abſolute, and powerfull; and whatſoever an Inſeriour power can do, the ſame can a Superiour Power perform, and much more excellently and efficaciouſly. An Angel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giving to Man Bread, Wine, Fruit, and other things, that grow out of the Earth, he takes nothing at all from without himſelf, but from within, of his own Penetrales, becauſe he is the perfect Image of <hi>GOD,</hi> he produces and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes when he will, and as oft as he will, without diminution or decreaſe: for an Angel bears all things about himſelf, and hath them in a Spiritual and Angelical manner; <note place="margin">

                     </note> yea he comprehends in himſelf the whole <hi>Machine</hi> of the World, and is all Inferiour things: And whatſoever Nature, and Art, by Nature, can do, that alſo the Spirit, or Angel conſtituted, and elevated above Nature, and Art, can much better, and more ſpedily perform. Who ſo with his Intellect and perfect ſight of the mind, doth diligently conſider this Centrale, or Circular <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> it will not be difficult for him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that an Angel, either can include the whole great Celeſtial Firmament in <hi>Camaaea,</hi> or the whole World in his Fiſt. Since that the Angel is the perfect and abſolute Image of <hi>GOD,</hi> and in his own <hi>Abyſs</hi> compriſeth, hath and poſſeſſeth all things, it cannot be denied that he is the Firſt, and Supream Cauſe, exiſting of himſelf, Independant, and complicates with himſelf all things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly, and Spiritually, in his own <hi>Abyſs:</hi> yea, all things are in the Fountain of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity most ſimply.

They chuſe out of themſelves a Captain, who cryes out while the whole Company ſleep. When in an exceeding great Multitude they flye, by courſe they appoint ſuch as ſhall cry out, who while the whole company are flying cries conſtantly, till they deſcend upon the Earth; then the Captain with loud acclamation cries out, that all may come and feed together; if through too much crying he be hoarſe, they ſubſtitute another in his ſtead. When they journey, by the ſharpneſs of their Senſes, they reduce their body in form of a Triangle, that with more eaſe they may cut the Air, then each of them leiſurely, as Oares are moved, from each ſide ſtir their wings, that without too much wearineſs they may fly far: If the Winds, or Stormes ariſe, not front-wiſe (they flye in form of the <hi>Lunar Globe,</hi> for more ſecurity in danger) but in a moment they change the form of their body like a Wedge. If by the <hi>Eagle</hi> they perceive themſelves in danger, they caſt themſelves Circular in form of a Globe, and then make a ſhew as if they prepared to encounter him, which perceived by the <hi>Eagle,</hi> he returnes and leaves them. In flying, they lay their necks upon the backs of them that flye formoſt (<hi>Harts</hi> in like manner do the ſame when they Swim over Rivers) and ſo render their labour more eaſie; and if the formoſt be weary, they afterwards flye hindmoſt, receiving the like benefit of laying their necks upon the others backs. When they reſt, all ſleep, ſave only the Captain, who by his voice ſignifies what he perceives. In like manner <hi>Geeſe</hi> celebrate Nocturnal watchings, and by their voyces teſtifie their wakefulneſs.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proceed happily in <hi>Chymical Practice,</hi> two things are moſt requiſite. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Phyſitian rightly know the Diſeaſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that he have convenient choyce Remedies alwayes at hand. The former is known by <hi>Pathology;</hi> the other which is called <hi>Therapeuſin,</hi> is chiefly <hi>Chimical.</hi> In <hi>Pathology,</hi> The moſt learned <hi>Fernelius</hi> adviſes. In <hi>Therapeuſin,</hi> which looks to <hi>Medicine, Chymicals</hi> are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, <hi>Viz. Specifick</hi> and <hi>Homogenial</hi> Remedies, in which two, the <hi>Spagirick</hi> method of Healing wholly conſiſts. Therefore before we come to Diſeaſes and Symptoms of particular parts, it will not be improper to inſert univerſal Medicaments, reduced into certain <hi>Claſſes,</hi> from which general Curations for peculiar Diſeaſes may be taken. Since in <hi>Phyſical Practice,</hi> the moſt frequent intention is Evacuation; we judge, not without Reaſon, that the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> underſtanding the Principal <hi>Nerve</hi> of Practice, will prudently affect the ſame by a right Adminiſtration of ſpeedy, ſafe, and pleaſant Remedies.</p>
                  <p>In the Cure of Principal Diſeaſes, of which we are about to treat, it would be of excellent benefit to the Sick, if the univerſal Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hereafter appointed almoſt for all Diſtempers, might preceed all other Medicine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> by four wayes is wont ordinarily to expel the Malignity of every Diſeaſe. 1. By the <hi>Superiour Parts.</hi> 2. By <hi>Urine.</hi> 3. By the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</hi> 4. By the whole <hi>Circumference</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> The <hi>Phyſitian</hi> therefore as <hi>Natures Miniſter</hi> doth imitate her, in appointing alſo four <hi>Claſſes</hi> of evacuating <hi>Medicaments,</hi> as <hi>Vomitories, Purges, Diureticks,</hi> and <hi>Diaphoreticks;</hi> and theſe, according to diverſities of Diſeaſes and Symptomes, he takes ſometimes from <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and ſometimes from <hi>Minerals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in ſeveral Diſeaſes, through defect of Natural <hi>Vigor,</hi> or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of <hi>Dolours,</hi> it very often happens, that the Sick had need be comforted, and the <hi>Dolours</hi> aſſwaged, therefore <hi>Confortatives</hi> and <hi>Anodynes</hi> are moſt needful, which in particular Cures must firſt be uſed.</p>

                  <p>COmmon Fame is ſtiled a Lyar, and not without cauſe; but EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERIENCE is well known to be the Daughter of Truth. Wherefore, ſince Fame, in the abſenee of EXPERIENCE, hath infamouſly belyed <hi>Alchimy,</hi> inſo much, as almoſt all <hi>Chimical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> have been reputed no leſs hurtfull, than Poyſon, it was neceſſary, that <hi>Experience</hi> ſhould be introduced, for enervating the villainons intentions of that STR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MPET. This being done, (the Almighty ſo favouring us) it is now on all hands granted, that <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girick Medicines</hi> are ſafe. Therefore the <hi>Hermetick</hi> Science ſeems to begin to reaſſume its priſtine Splendor, and Medicine by it to be reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and reduced to a more excellent, and ſublime Condition; in which Renovation, the deplorable estate, and Condition of the ſick is meliorated, their grievous afflictions being removed with greater faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and eaſe, than formerly, they could find. Yet that nothing may be wanting to inform, and inſtruct the ingenious and well diſpoſed of this Kingdom, in the moſt neceſſary Science of Medicine; this Book, with the Precedent, are preſented to them, in their own native Tongue; which undoubtedly will be more acceptable, than if they had ſtill remained in the Latin Dialect. Both theſe <hi>Authors</hi> were Phiſitians of <hi>Germany,</hi> and Imitators of that wonder in Nature, PARACELS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, the Prince of Phiſitians, and Philoſophers. The <hi>Author</hi> of this ſubſequent Book, was a Laborious, and Judicious Practitioner of Medicine, and a dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and expert Artiſt in <hi>Spagyrick</hi> Preparations, as is evident, by the Proceſſes of his Practice in healing the ſick, &amp;c. here inſerted in his <hi>Practical Chymiſtry.</hi> The order and method of which by him therein obſerved) he gives you in his own Proemium, placed before the ſubſequent Work. In which Work more may be learned, than in many other Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes of far greater Bulk: for he treats of all Internal Diſeaſes, incident to all parts of the Microcoſme; and briefly toucheth on ſome external Affects, &amp;c. and of their Remedies, with a proper and ſutable way of adhibiting; ſhewing a direct method, by which all Accidents, like to be ſupervenient, are to be removed, &amp;c. Thus have you in this, and the precedent, as it were, the intire Body of Phyſick; God grant it be rightly uſed. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

In the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part make a door with a glaſs window, that may open and ſhut; in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part make handles of Iron wherewith to move or carry it: In the bottom make a wooden grate, in the middle a ſeat, with a foot-ſtool near adjoyning to the grate to ſet the feet upon; Under the wooden grate of all the four ſides, make moveable wooden ſhutters, through which in Iron pans (Tin pans will be ſpoiled with the vinegar) may be put hot vinegar, or burning wine; the vapour ariſing from the wine or vinegar, will ſtrike through the <hi>Stove</hi> all over the body, except the head.

                     <p>Every Dolour is removed three wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By ſuch things as remove the cauſe, and contrary the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>Anodynes,</hi> which are paragoricall, and do mitigate, pacifie, and gently aſſwage the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By Narcoticks which make the dolour not to be perceived; theſe do not properly take away the pain, unleſs happily by ſleep, (which being inwardly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51328:142"/>taken they Cauſe) it be mitigated and diſſolved. Vehement dolour diſcovers the Narcotick to be a mitigating <hi>Anodyne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If therefore the grief ariſe from an intemperate heat of the brain, or from the exhaling of hot vapours, as in Fevers; at firſt ſtrive to evacuate them by a Clyſter, then cut a veine; if the Head-ach, or indiſpoſition of the whole body ſtill remain, or which is worſe, if the body look very ill, apply to the parts of the <hi>Precordia</hi> Cuppinglaſſes with ſcarification; yea they muſt alſo be often applyed without ſcarification in great dolours, on the very ſame day. Then apply to the fore-head an <hi>Anodyne</hi> thus made.</p>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Laudan. Opiat</hi> ℈ <abbr>ſs</abbr>; water of Night-ſhade, of Roſes, of each ℥ iij, Roſe Vinegar ℥ j and <abbr>ſs</abbr>; mix theſe: moyſten linnen clothes in it, and apply to the fore-head. Alſo let the ſick often ſmell to Roſe water, in which Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire is diſſolved, and ſometimes waſh his face with the ſame. Inwardly, let ſuch things be given, as may alter the intemperance, drive forth the noxious humours, and which have the force of <hi>Anodynes;</hi> Such are the <hi>Laudanums</hi> above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>If by this means the dolour abate not, uſe <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> which apply to the fore-head or nape of the neck.</p>
                     <p>But if the dolour ariſe from an intemperate cold of the brain, either with or without matter, the Medicines aforeſaid muſt be forborn, and ſuch things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed as are in common uſe with <hi>Practitioners:</hi> Among which, moſt proper to the diſeaſe are theſe: <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Oximel</hi> of <hi>Squills, water of Elder flowers, Oyl and water of Peneroyal, Roſemary, Dill and Wild Alexander;</hi> which two laſt, or one of them, muſt be outwardly applyed, not omitting the former, which remove pains of this kind, digeſt and diſſipate the matter, or ſo diſpoſe of it, that afterward with <hi>Errhinis and Apophlegmatiſm's</hi> they may eaſily be expell'd and diſſipated.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of theſe applyed to the Temples, Fore-head, and Suture Coronale is very convenient; alſo Oyl of Nutmegs made by expreſſion, and <hi>Apoplectick Balſom</hi> applyed to the Noſtrills, and Balſom of <hi>Amber,</hi> and of <hi>Cinamon:</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe caps of ſilk or linnen quilted with Aromatick Spices, and Cephalick Herbs; and ſuch as are made with four parts of Millet, and one part of <hi>Salt decrepitated.</hi> The caps muſt be well warmed and applyed to the head three or four times a day.</p>
                     <p>And if by ordinary Remedies the dolour be not aſſwaged, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to draw bliſters in the lower parts behind the eares, lay upon them Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort leaves, and keep them open. If you would heal them up, anoint them with white Oyntment of <hi>Rhaſis.</hi> Alſo if the diſeaſe continue long and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, a potential or actual <hi>Seton</hi> or <hi>Cautery</hi> may be applyed.</p>
                     <p>If the dolour of the head ariſe from the foulneſs of the ſtomack, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, or by Intervalls; infuſion made of <hi>Crocus</hi> of <hi>Mettals,</hi> or flowers of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> in <hi>Betony</hi> or <hi>Mint</hi> water, may be often exhibited.</p>
                     <p>In dolours cauſed by cold humours <hi>Mercury</hi> with ſublimate <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> or <hi>Panacaea,</hi> are very profitable.

Theſe uſually cure the ſtomack, and alſo the head, which muſt likewiſe be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſweet Balſoms, and other ſuch things, being as well taken inwardly, as outwardly applyed.</p>
                     <p>In every pain of the head diſtill'd water of <hi>Verveine</hi> is commended as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Arcanum,</hi> ℥ iv of which being taken with four drops of ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi>

The uſe is thus:</p>
                     <p>Cut one of the twigs into ſmall ſhort pieces, not ſlit, but whole; tye nine of theſe in a knot, either with ſilk or thread, ſo tyed hang it in one ſingle thread; Tye this about the neck as low as the Orifice of the Ventricle, that the knot may touch it. Apply this knot after the exhibition of other Medicines, to cleanſe the body, and expell the dregs of the Diſeaſe; put it on what time you pleaſe either before or after the Fit. The knot muſt be worn ſo long, till of its own accord without any violence the thread be broken, and the knot is ſeen to fall, which not the Patient himſelf, nor any other living muſt touch with hands or feet, but with an iron fork or other convenient inſtrument, it muſt be buried in the earth ſo deep, as neither man nor beaſt may come at it; If he that had the Diſeaſe, or any other that never had it ſhall happen to touch it, the <hi>Epilepſie</hi> doth immediately invade him. With this <hi>Amulet</hi> have been cured ſuch as have laboured under this Diſeaſe for a very long time.</p>
                     <p>After the Cure the Patient muſt diligently ſtrive to preſerve himſelf from all the external cauſes of which we have ſpoken before, otherwiſe he will be again infeſted.</p>

                     <p>The Specifick Cure is thus:</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

Or elſe give to drink ℥ ij or iij of diſtill'd water of <hi>Onions</hi> or <hi>Garlick,</hi> and the maw-worms will certainly dye or be expell'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The maw-worms being thus deſtroyed, if Convulſion, and return of the Fits be, it is a moſt certain ſign of worms in the heart: Therefore exhibit Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Extracts of <hi>Garlick, Horſe-radiſh</hi> and <hi>Water-creſſes;</hi> Doſe ℈ j in broath or Liquor wherein the <hi>Radiſhes</hi> have been before macerated; by this means the Cure will ſpeedily follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> In defect of the Extracts, one, two or three ſpoonfulls of the juice of each of them may be ſufficient. The ſalts of theſe Simples rightly prepared are more excellent.</p>

                     <p>It is very convenient after the cleanſing of Ulcers to ſprinkle on them the powder of the inward ſkins of Eggs which included the young.

The Cancer is a foul tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, in ſight unequal, ſometimes with pain. It takes its name from <hi>Crabs.</hi> This Vice is in every part of Humane Body, both external and internal, which receive from Nature a conſtant purgation; the parts weak and thin, greedily receive the thick melancholly matter: of the melancholly humour is generated vehement heats, which becoming more ſharp produce ulceration.</p>
                     <p>There are different kinds of Cancers, ſome without Ulcers, others ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The ſigns are tumours with great inflammation, waxing black without very great heat, and the veins in the whole habit of the body ſwell, becauſe the unprofitable blood is attracted from the Centre, therefore the veins are puffed up.</p>
                     <p>The colour of the Cancer is like aſhes, livid and inclining to Purple, in touch moſt hard, yet ſometimes accompanied with dolorous prickings, chiefly when in the <hi>Jaws</hi> or <hi>Breaſts,</hi> but in ſome other parts it procures dolour, and in ſome not.</p>
                     <p>The Cancer is diverſe both as to place and matter; by reaſon of the matter when the humours are mixt, <hi>viz. Melancholly</hi> and <hi>Choller</hi> together; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the place, when it is either in the Face, Lips, Noſe, Fore-head, Hands or Fingers, as I have learned by experience; theſe parts are uſually free from pain; but if in the breaſt there is pricking dolours; in the ſecret part alſo pain is wont to be.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes in the Lips, Noſe, corners of the Eyes, Fore-head, and in every part of the Face are bred as it were <hi>Warts</hi> in form of <hi>Vetches,</hi> which afterward dilate and encreaſe like <hi>Muſhrums,</hi> with lips brawny and turn'd inward, which are wont to ſend forth blood or virulent matter. In the Fore-head they dilate themſelves by violent corroding.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind or ſpecies which comes not at all to an Ulcer, but is a tumour or hard ſwelling in the ſkin, livid, and never ulcerates, yet alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes. Tumours of this kind are wont to grow in the Neck, Liver, Spleen, Privities and Matrix, ſeldom in other parts of the body. I have ſeen none, only at <hi>Padua</hi> in the Noſe of one Woman.</p>

                     <p>In Cure of the Cancer an order of Diet muſt be appointed, wherein care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully muſt be avoiding ſuch things as generate Melancholly juice; <hi>Ptiſane, Barley, Mallowes,</hi> Herb <hi>Orage, Beet,</hi> and all things that generate good blood, and are eaſie of digeſtion may be uſed. Drink may be thin, white-wine not very old.</p>
                     <p>Evacuation muſt firſt be endeavoured by taking away blood, as ſtrength and age will permit. The middle vein in the back may be cut, and eſpecially means uſed to provoke the <hi>Menſes,</hi> afterward the peccant humour evacuated by ſuitable medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Things purging are <hi>Epithymon, Sena, Polipode, Whey</hi> of <hi>milk,</hi> and compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this kind, as Confection of <hi>Sena,</hi> Confection of <hi>Bugloſs,</hi> and Pill of the <hi>Azure-ſtone.</hi>

                     <p>Afterward it will be neceſſary to repell or diſcuſs the humour lurking in the part, which, though very little, leaſt unto it a greater abundance of matter flow, ſome repercuſſive muſt be applyed round about the affected, which being done ſprinkle upon it the <hi>Bleſſed Powder</hi> given to me by the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> for the Utility of Man-kind.</p>
                     <p>It behoves the Phyſician to obſerve this method; let him alwayes with faſting ſpittle apply <hi>Bombace.</hi> If the Cancer be ulcerated, the Ulcer being firſt wiped clean from all filth and corrupt matter, let him take the powder and ſprinkle it all over the Sore, as fiſh are wont to be ſprinkled with Flower be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be fryed, and with the aforeſaid <hi>Bombace</hi> cover it and annoint it round about with faſting ſpittle, that it may ſtick, when it ſticks it will not fall off, untill together with it the roots be eradicated. This is wont at firſt laying on to procure great dolour, when the ſharp and corroding humour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be purged out through the Ulcer (yea, although the tumour be great at that time, the Medicament muſt neither be removed, nor any other put on, but muſt be annointed round about with Oyl of <hi>Roſes,</hi> and left untill it fall off of it ſelf;) when the ſharp humour is purged by the Ulcer no more pain remains; this muſt then be purged as other Ulcers. I alwayes uſe incarnative, cleanſing and digeſtive powder, made only of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and yolks of <hi>Eggs,</hi> with Oyntment of <hi>Lithargy</hi> and <hi>Mumy,</hi> of which I hereafter deſcribe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Preparation.</p>
                     <p>This muſt alwayes be diligently minded, that if any part of the roots re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, the powder muſt be again applyed: Sometimes it happens that after the roots are removed, one Cancer grows as it were from (or upon) another, as in the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> then it behoves to reiterate the powder untill all the Evils be removed. Thoſe Cancers are moſt difficult of Cure when they are in parts of the inward breaſt, becauſe their roots are between (or in) the parts of the ſtomack.</p>
                     <p>I have cured many Women, when the Cancer hath been ulcerated, only with this Plaiſter following; I took <hi>Ammoniack</hi> diſſolved in Vinegar, and with it moſt excellently purged the malignant juice of the Cancer, in ſuch a manner as no corrupted matter was attracted to the affected part, and have often repeated it to a perfect Cure.

                     <p>In Diarrhea and Dyſentery Epidemical, after the uſe of vomitories, recourſe muſt be had to Antidotes.</p>
                     <p>Diarrhaea, becauſe it riſes from various cauſes, and is alwayes the Effect of another diſeaſe, diligence muſt be uſed to know from what cauſe it hath its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and whether it be Critical, the cuſtom of Nature, or Symptomaticall. If from any external errour it happen, or from any intemperance of the parts,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51328:175"/>or from abundance of humour; all which, if the Phyſitian rightly obſerve, it will not be difficult for him to effect the Cure.</p>
                     <p>In general, it is to be Noted, that no ſuch diſtemper is cured ſuddenly, or can be ſpeedily ſuppreſt and reſtrained, unleſs by chance in P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The aſſwaging of this muſt alwayes be begun with moſt gentle and weak Medicaments, as by giving Confection of <hi>Quinces</hi> alone, or Conſerve of <hi>Quinces</hi> compounded. Outwardly the belly muſt be annointed with Oyl of <hi>Quinces, Maſtich, Nard, Wormwood, Mint,</hi> and <hi>milk</hi> in which ſteele is quenched maybe given the quantity of one Cupfull, to which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Terra ſigillata</hi> ℈ j; and this drunk in the morning faſting, and four hours before meat in the Evening, helps much in all diſtempers of this kind: But if ſtrength be decayed, recourſe muſt be had to things more ſtrong, then to Clyſters and Medicaments, firſt cleanſing, then aſtringent, as well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal as internal, of which more in the <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Dyſentery:</hi> Yet ſo as reſpect be alwayes had to the parts affected. In <hi>Externals</hi> it is to be noted, whether the outward Muſcles be not drawn together, for thereby the evil is encreaſed. Conſtrictions of the Muſcles augments the Laxity, therefore it is beſt to rarifie the parts, that the Medicine may penetrate the bowells, which is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by addition of vinegar in fomentations and cataplaſms.</p>
                     <p>In every Flux of the belly it will be profitable to apply a Plaiſter of old <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> and a like quantity of <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> to the Region of the belly. Of great vertue alſo in every defluxion of the belly is ſyrup of dry <hi>Roſes,</hi> ſyrup of <hi>Myrtles, Gooſeberries, Berber,</hi> and <hi>Quercetanus</hi> his ſyrup of <hi>Coralls, Burnt Harts-horn,</hi> and the Inteſtines of a <hi>Hen,</hi> firſt waſht in aſtringent water, then dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an Oven, and reduced to powder. The <hi>Lyſentery</hi> by theſe Remedies is ſcarcely cured, by reaſon of the Levity of the Inteſtines, which muſt be helped by corroborating and heating the ſtomack and bowells. And ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that from a Phlegmatick water the parts are made ſlippery, which muſt be corrected with Expurgations.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo convenient in this caſe to apply a ſmall Cuppinglaſſe to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, that it may retain the food longer.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſtemper ariſe from a <hi>Flux</hi> of Phlegme to the bowells, or from any externall errour, theſe altered and taken away the Diſeaſe is eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Flux</hi> be by reaſon of Obſtructions in the Meſentery Veins, or imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Liver, the cauſe muſt be removed with attractive medicaments. Chiefly powerful in <hi>Flux</hi> of the Liver is Salt of <hi>Corals</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Plantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi> from ℈ j to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>

                     <p>In immoderate deflux of the Hemrodes, all things uſeful in ſtopping <hi>Fluxes</hi> of blood are profitable. Yet theſe are commended:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Crocus</hi> of Iron, of which ſee <hi>Crollius;</hi> this muſt as long be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, as the <hi>Flux</hi> continues violent; otherwiſe by delaying time, and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Medicine, it is like never to be ſtopt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By a certain propriety, of Excellent uſe is a Girdle made of the green leaves of black <hi>Hellebore</hi> bruiſed, and tyed about the naked body. The leaves muſt be a little bruiſed, for ſo the hard veins in them will not be offenſive, ſew theſe up in a ſwadling band that they may be long and narrow like a Girdle. This I have happily uſed. It is good in all immoderate <hi>Fluxes</hi> of the <hi>Menſes,</hi> and chiefly in the <hi>Flux</hi> of blood from the Arteries, when all other means have been unſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Powder of forraign <hi>Mummy,</hi> with a like quantity of Cork finely bruiſed, which muſt be carefully applyed to the Orifice of the veins of the Hemrodes; this ſuddenly ſtops the blood.</p>

                     <p>The Diſeaſe being known, ſuch medicaments ought to be applyed, as in this caſe ſeldom are, for what is uſually adminiſtred, ſeems rather to exaſperate the grief, which indeed is no wonder, ſince the diſtemper is ſo little conſidered by the Phyſitians, wherefore oftentimes from ſuch like affects, the <hi>Iliack</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is produced.</p>
                     <p>Therefore moſt worthy to be praiſed, is the famouſly learned <hi>Fernelius,</hi> who by his ſingular induſtry, and ingenious dexterity, hath diſcovered ſuch things, as in this place, may gently help the practical Phyſitian.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe being perfectly known, a Remedy as eaſily may be found. The whole cure conſiſts in reſolving and emollient medicines.</p>

But if in Tumours of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> the ſlow dejection of the belly which is uſually concomitant, be not by theſe means removed, <hi>Tartariſate ſpirit</hi> of Wine given drop by drop, makes the belly ſoluble. <hi>Emollient,</hi> are powerful externals; if among theſe a Plaiſter of <hi>Hemlock</hi> be applyed, the Cure will more readily be affected; It is obſervable, that oftentimes, from the applying of this Plaiſter dolours begin to ariſe, which is a moſt certain ſign, that the putrid filth contracted from the preceeding inflammation is diſturbed, and reſolving into impoſthumation; it hath been often ſeen, that by this means the corrupt matter is rarified and almoſt diſſolved, then this Plaiſter muſt be removed, and a Clyſter injected.</p>

                     <p>After the Cure is perfected, it is convenient once or twice yearly, to uſe Lenitive purgations, leaſt the part again receiving thoſe impurities, be made apt to retain them and a more contumacious return of the Diſeaſe unavoidably follow.</p>

                     <p>A Decoction of <hi>Strawberries</hi> with the ſmaller <hi>Raiſons,</hi> made in fountain water, by a certain propriety diſſolves the Jaundies, eſpecially in Children.

This muſt be drunk to the declining of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>If the Jaundies be ſymptomatical and obſtructions of the Liver commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, remove the cauſe and thoſe will alſo decline.

                     <p>Hypocondriack melancholly beginning, or ſimple, is for the moſt part cured with <hi>Rulands Aqua bened.</hi> for by exterminating the contracted filth out of the ſtomack and neighbouring parts, the cure is made more eaſie, which if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, to remove the Obſtructions would be more difficult.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Aperitives may be applyed, as <hi>Cream</hi> of <hi>Tartar, Vitriolate Tartar,</hi> wine of <hi>Iron, Cachectick</hi> powder, either before or after vomiting: In directing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe the prudence of the Phyſitian is required, on which depends the moſt weighty part of the Cure; oftentimes ſucceſs is loſt, if he proceed not warily, religiouſly, and cordially.</p>
                     <p>Next to Vomitories, in this Caſe things purging Choler and Melancholly are very commodious, ſuch are theſe, <hi>Laxative</hi> powder of <hi>Sena, Extract</hi> of <hi>Rubarb, Mechoachanna, Panchymagogon</hi> of <hi>Crollius, Extract</hi> of <hi>black Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> by which (if need be) evacuations are laudably effected: So <hi>Extract</hi> of Pills of <hi>Ammoniack</hi> (of which above) is here alſo very beneficial.</p>
                     <p>To mitigate ſymptoms, which for the moſt part ariſe from diſtended windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> piercing the Animal Spirits of the brain: Care muſt be taken to ſtrengthen thoſe Noble parts, if theſe Obſtructions continue, uſe <hi>Magiſtery</hi> and Salt of <hi>Coral</hi> and <hi>Pearls,</hi> the <hi>Bezoar ſtone, tincture</hi> of <hi>Corals, Elixir proprietatis,</hi> (<hi>Note,</hi> this is ſingular) and Oyl of <hi>Saffron;</hi> for theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſtrengthen the heart and brain.</p>

                     <p>Experience proves, that thoſe Aperitives do ſometimes profit and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the malignity of the humour; yet its return by intervalls, and freſh aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults cannot be prevented, nor the Diſeaſe eradicated by ſuch means only.</p>
                     <p>Therefore are appointed yearly the uſe of ſoweriſh medicaments, which remove ſome Obſtructions cauſing the Diſeaſe, but the Malady it ſelf do not wholly take away.

                     <p>Deſperate Conſumption of the body nothing profited by other medicines, I have ſometimes cured in this manner. ℞. <hi>Virgins-honey</hi> what quantity you pleaſe; with this annoint a new unglazed earthen pot all over within; then place the pot in a heap of ſtubble gathered by Piſmires quite buried up to the neck, cover the orifice of the Pot with a ſieve that is indifferent wide, and ſo the Ants running upon the ſieve will fall into the Honey, and there ſtick; hereby no chaff or other impurity will fall into the Pot.

One ſpoonful of this water exhibited with a piece of bread toaſted three or four times a week for ſeveral weeks together, doth mirably reſtore the conſumptive body. In the mean while the whole body, or only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts, as hands, armes and legs, muſt ſometimes be bathed with the ſame liquor.</p>
                     <p>But if the Cure be detarded, and follow not the uſe of theſe Remedies; then proceed in the following manner; (this Magnetick Cure is alſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Feavers:) See below in <hi>Aridura.</hi> ℞. A new laid Egg, boyle it in a new earthen pipkin, with the Urine of the Conſumptive perſon, ſo as the Urine cover the Egg, let it boyle till it be very hard, then take off the pipkin, and take out the Egg, which with a wooden ſkewer ſtrike full of holes all over, that the yolk may be ſeen through the holes; afterward boyle this Egg now full of holes, in the ſame Urine, alwayes turning the Egg till all the Urine is conſumed: Laſtly, this thus prepared bury in an Ant-hill: And when the Egg ſhall be eaten up and conſumed by the Ants; by a wonderful ſympathy the Conſumption of the body declines, and the priſtine nutrication happily follows. But in the mean time, the uſing the former liquor muſt not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>In the Conſumption ariſing from little worms in the ſkin of Children, about the muſculous and fleſhly parts, generated of bad nutriment. This following without any other addition is an approved Cure. ℞.

But after this, the ſame operation muſt be repeated once or twice, untill it be certainly known, that all the worms be deſtroyed; afterward bathe the Children ſometimes in the Baths above deſcribed, which are prepared either with heads and feet of ſheep, or red barks of Willows.</p>

                        <hi>Internalls,</hi> are ſuch as by a certain propriety extinguiſh the inflammations of the innate humidity; this performs <hi>Lapis Prunella,</hi> very quickly, for by it the belly is freed, otherwiſe this buſineſs may be effected with a gentle Extract of <hi>Mechoachanna,</hi> or with infuſion of <hi>Ruharb.</hi> In this caſe ſometimes we are wont, and that happily, to exhibit a decoction of ſweet Prunes with water of <hi>Tartar, (viz.</hi> in which moſt pure <hi>Tartar</hi> is boyled.)

The Cure of Obſtructions beginning is one, but if of long continuance, it muſt be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe effected. For this requireth another Cure, of which we Treat in the <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gravel</hi> in the Reins, properly ſo called.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chryſtals</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> are of like vertue, for they diſſolve and expell Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the <hi>Tartar</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>But when indeed all Obſtructions of the veins ariſe from the <hi>Tartar</hi> in the body, whether they be green, or confirmed, it is beſt to apply a Specifick, by the force and innate propriety of which, all the <hi>Tartar</hi> in mans body may be wonderfully removed, and ſo all Obſtructions throughly expell'd; and this vertue chiefly is manifeſted in this affect of the Reins.</p>
                     <p>Which alſo is powerful in old Obſtructions ariſing from contracted gravel hardned to a ſtone; which it inſenſibly, and almoſt without pain daily breaks away in a ſlimy thin ſubſtance by the Urine, and by little and little wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves. This is called by <hi>Paracelſus Ludum humani</hi> prepared, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly commends, yet hath not any where left its genuine preparation: That which he left is thus; ℞. <hi>Ludum,</hi> or the ſtone that is cut, or any other way drawn, out of Mans body (one part; powder of Coals, chiefly of <hi>Beech,</hi> two parts, mix them, when pulveriſate) Calcine it in an open fire at firſt gently, afterward reverberate it with ſtrong fire, till it be plainly reduced to Salt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> Here is another ſeeret way of Calcination, which hitherto I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to none. ℞. Powder of <hi>Ludum humani</hi> one part, powder of Coals of <hi>Beech</hi> two parts, mix them together; put this in an Earthen pot, covered with a Tile or other convenient ſtopple, burn it in a potters furnace for twenty four hours; and the ſpirit of the coals by the benefit of the fire will ſoften the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtone, yet the coles themſelves will not be conſumed: Upon this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51328:190"/>mixture pour boyling water, or boyle it in hot water, and the powder of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> will diſſolve into water of an <hi>Orange</hi> colour, which colour ariſes from the fetid <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the ſtone it ſelf. If any part remain undiſſolved by this ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then dry it, and add freſh powder of Coals, and again Calcine it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. All the ſolutions by evaporating reduce to a Salt; joyn all theſe with powder of coals, and again Calcine them: when Calcined diſſolve it in boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, ſo the moſt pure part after evaporation will be found converted into a white Salt, which will eaſily Cryſtallize, if ſet for ſome time in a cold moiſt place. Joyn this moſt excellent Salt with the beſt ſpirit of wine, and in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort by diſtillation cohobate it much, till all the Salt with the Spirit be wholly come over: Afterward <hi>in Balneo</hi> with gentle heat draw off the Spirit, and the Oyl of <hi>Ludum humani</hi> will remain in the bottom. Of which from three to ſix, ten, or twelve drops exhibited certain times in convenient liquor, (but) once a day, all the tartarous Obſtructions of the body, (in the brain and tongue) eſpecially of the Reins, doth happily reſolve and expell the <hi>Tartar;</hi> alſo in confirmed <hi>Tartar</hi> it is of excellent uſe.</p>
                     <p>Annointing externally with more common Unguents help to diſſolve Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Reins: Alſo Plaiſters, Baths, Cataplaſms, and ſuch like are uſeful.</p>
                     <p>Memorable in this Caſe is Oyl of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> mixt with
living—worms, and the dolorous part annointed therewith.</p>
                     <p>Of the like vertue is a preparation of <hi>Crabs</hi> eyes; though ſomewhat infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, yet is very powerful.</p>
                     <p>After the above recited manner all ſtones may be reduced into their own Oyls, and ſo converted to Medicinal uſe.</p>
                     <p>This Specifick of <hi>Ludum humani,</hi> is the only thing powerful to remove old Obſtructions, cauſed by the hard congealing of the contracted gravel, which it inſenſibly, and almoſt without pain daily breaks away in a ſlimy thin ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is carried out by the Urine, and by little and little wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.

I prepare it thus; In the months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> I gather a great quantity of them, and cut them, taking out all the little worms, or other inſects growing in the Cavities, or hanging about them; by fermentation with water and common ferment, I draw forth a ſpirit and a water <hi>per Veſicam.</hi> Of the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> converted to aſhes I extract a Salt, which when purified I again joyn with the ſpirit, and macerate it by digeſtion for ſome time, then I mix it with <hi>Argilla,</hi> and in the fire of ſuppreſſion, by diſtillation I draw forth more ſpirit, together with the Salt; that which remains in the veſſel, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and the Expreſs by Retort in Sand (with fire toward the end not too ſtrong, leaſt it ſmell of the fire) I diſtil after the manner of an <hi>Arcanum,</hi> as other <hi>Arcanums</hi> of Vegetables are made.</p>
                     <p>Doſe of this from <hi>Gr.</hi> iij to xij, which often exhibited, and in convenient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, doth inſenſibly expel the Stone.

                     <p>Exulceration of the Reins is acknowledged Curable, if but of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, as well by <hi>Dogmatical</hi> as <hi>Hermetical</hi> Phyſitians.</p>

                     <p>In exulcerations of the Reins and bladder, the Plant <hi>Aloes</hi> well bruiſed and mixt with milk, and given to the Patient to drink, with other things of like effect, yield no ſmall benefit to the ſick, but are attended with very good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; nay, <hi>Garzias</hi> affirms they do preſently Cure.</p>

                     <p>In Obſervation, I have found from ſeveral Examples, that <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> is in this caſe very profitable, if exhibited before other Medicines, (in a juſt Doſe, ſometimes in a week, as twice or thrice, reſpecting the ſtrength of the Patient) it doth not only cleanſe the impurities of the whole body, but chiefly of the Reins.</p>
                     <p>If in this caſe ſpirit of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> be applyed, no exulcerations can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Spirit of <hi>Mercu. dulcis</hi> is thus:</p>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Cryſtaline Mercury</hi> ſublimate (not <hi>Mercu. dulcis</hi>) what quantity you pleaſe, grind it to an impalpable powder, in a conveniently large Cucurbit, pour on the beſt ſpirit of Wine, abſtract it by a Limbeck in aſhes, pour on the diſtill'd Liquor again, and re-diſtil it, go on <hi>per Cohobiam</hi> ſo long as till you perceive the diſtill'd ſpirit of Wine, to paſs the Limbeck like to a white Oyl, which gather in another Receiver. Upon the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> in the bottom of the Cucurbit pour other freſh ſpirit of wine; proceed in like manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, untill all be come forth like white Oyl or Spirit. This Spirit of <hi>Mercury</hi> in exulcerations of the reins and bladder doth wonderfully operate, if two or three drops of this be daily exhibited once or twice in water of the roots of <hi>Nymphea, Horſetayle,</hi> and <hi>Plantane.</hi>

After purgation to cut a vein, and after procuring of Urine, Evacuation may be appointed for ſeveral months.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Patient muſt be purged with ſome proper medicament that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries the Stone in the Reins and Bladder.

Alwayes ſo appoint that the ſick before the receiving this Specifick, may take ſome emollient gentle Clyſter, purging without <hi>Acrimony,</hi> (unleſs the belly be ſoluble before.) The uſe of this <hi>Specifick</hi> reſiſts the Feaver; and thence forward throughout the whole courſe of the Cure, a convenient diet with moyſtning meats muſt be uſed, leaſt at any time the belly be obſtructed: From the beginning of the Cure, no wine muſt be given till the ſixteenth day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> After the taking the <hi>Specifick</hi> a preternatural <hi>Heat</hi> all over the body follows. Alſo great thirſt, and dolours are felt about the privities.</p>
                     <p>This medicament doth forcibly invade the ſtone of the bladder, therefore all hot things muſt carefully be avoided: Sometimes a little <hi>Lapis prunella</hi> in water of <hi>Strawberries</hi> or <hi>Bean-ſlowers</hi> may be given. Alſo a <hi>Julep</hi> of thoſe waters with Syrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> and three or four drops of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> may be exhibited. The firſt dayes after taking theſe, the Urine will come forth very thick, and but little; but after five dayes, and ſo forward to ten, eleven and twelve dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It will come forth more abundantly, the heat be remitted, the dolours abated, and the whole ſubſtance of the Stone will, reſolving into exceeding ſmall parts, be evacuated.</p>
                     <p>The Urine in the whole courſe of the Cure being ſaved, and after boyling dryed, thereby will be diſcovered the quantity of the Stone, if it be wrought together, with ſolution of <hi>Tragacant</hi> or <hi>Water-glue.</hi>

                     <p>This I have obſerved, that ſometimes the medicament is injected by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge to the bladder, and the ſick preſently placed in a Bath, and after bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the breaſt and <hi>Perineum</hi> annointed with Oyl of <hi>Scorpions,</hi> of bitter <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Coneys greaſe</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>It often happens, that the virulent <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> diſcovers it ſelf without any teſtimony of infection; that is, when none other of the outward parts of the body ſeem to be affected, only the diſpoſition of the whole body bewrayes it, and without any other notable ſymptome this evil may be hid.</p>
                     <p>Lying with Common Harlots encreaſeth this infection by ſuſpition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion: Although by this means Phyſitians themſelves may be oft-times deceived, yet the ſpontaneous or extorted confeſſion of the Patient himſelf reſolves the doubt.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe therefore, where there are no external ſigns of infection (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Lues venerea</hi>) and the uſual medicaments are not powerful enough; uſe muſt be made of this <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> In this caſe <hi>Antimonial Pills</hi> which only purge downward are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commendable.</p>
                     <p>If daily or every other day five or eight drops of the ſimple <hi>Tincture,</hi> or one drop of the exalted <hi>Tincture,</hi> be exhibited in the morning in <hi>Diaphoretick in peracutis,</hi> or <hi>mixtura ſimplex,</hi> and ſweating provoked either in a Stove or Bed, no <hi>Arthritick-contracture</hi> can long abide.</p>
                     <p>To the external Cure of the Gout contracted, yet not too inveterate, after the uſe of the foregoing Medicaments, and the obſervation of orderly, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate diet, of which we have hitherto treated, external Auxiliaries are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſuch (I mean) as by penetration may reſolve thoſe hard knottineſſes in the joynts, like ſo many compounded Diſeaſes, not reſolvable (or very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly) by internal Medicines, and draw out from the joynts whatſoever is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneal. Therefore where the knottineſſes are not too inveterate, this plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is ſingularly commended, which doth not only aſſwage the dolour, but by reſolving gently opens the skin, and extracts the hardned matter, or coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Sulphur.</hi> The Plaiſter is thus made.</p>

Of this and of <hi>Barley flower</hi> a like quantity, mix it with Lees of Wine till it be like a Poultis, which, after the uſual manner ſpread upon a linnen cloth indifferent thick, apply to the place affected, and leave it on. When it is dry temper more with the Lees of Wine, and continue applying it till firſt all the dolour be removed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the hard knottineſs alſo taken away: In the mean time by this means the skin is oftentimes opened, without much dolour, eſpecially if any Scurffs or Warts be in the joynts. And the skin broken is either of its own accorded cloſed, or by the application of wax ſometimes inſtead of the plaiſter, conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, and the joynts themſelves rendred agile and moveable.</p>
                     <p>But if the diſtemper be too inveterate, and the contracted knottineſs ſtill remain, by this external Cure mittigation of the pains may be hoped, but the knotts themſelves hardly removed, without addition of more powerful <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery:</hi> Then therefore proceed after this manner.</p>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Mercury ſublimate, white Arſenick,</hi> of each what quantity you pleaſe; mix them with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and make it like a Poultis; then apply to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected place a Plaiſter of <hi>Baſilicon</hi> the greater, (or other defenſive) let this Plaiſter have a hole in it, upon which put the preſcribed poultis, as Lint is wont to be laid on, and preſently upon it put another piece of the aforeſaid Plaiſter, and leave it on for ſometime untill the skin be well opened, and no tumour at all be, and till an <hi>Eſcara</hi> be made; then by emollients remove the <hi>Eſcara,</hi> as with freſh butter, or Oyl of <hi>Roſes;</hi> and apply ſome Specifick attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, which may reſolve all the coagulated <hi>Tartars,</hi> and extract them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo they of themſelves break away after the uſe of the aboveſaid, and crumble away as mortar falls from a wall. After the ceſſation of the Flux of humour, the place muſt be conſolidated with conſolidating Medicaments, and vulgar <hi>Epuloticks.</hi>

                     <p>An <hi>Attractive Plaiſter</hi> is thus made; ℞. <hi>Lithargy, Lapis Calaminaris, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Magnet,</hi> of each ℥ ij; pulveriſate all theſe very well, and boyle them in <abbr>lb</abbr>

If pain or return of the Fit be, the Sick is not to be diſquieted with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Medicines, but rather give himſelf to reſt for mitigating the dolour; only care muſt be taken to remit the dolour, and to prevent affluxion of matter to the part affected.</p>
                     <p>The dolour is aſſwaged by a Doſe of <hi>Laudanum</hi> inwardly taken, yet it is beſt firſt to inject a Clyſter. If dolour in the head be, cut a vine.</p>
                     <p>Aſtringents outwardly may be applyed a little above the affected part, as aſtringent powder made with vinegar and whites of Eggs, or with aſtringent water, as of <hi>Myrtles, Knotgraſs</hi> and <hi>Acorns:</hi> Or, Cataplaſms made of ſower fruits, as <hi>Quince-pears,</hi> ſower Herbs, other <hi>Pears, Sloes,</hi> chiefly <hi>wild Sloes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> to which may be added flower of <hi>Lentills,</hi> with powder of <hi>Pomegranate flowers,</hi> of <hi>Galls, Roſes, Biſtort,</hi> or <hi>Bole-armenack</hi> alone may be applyed with milk and powder of <hi>Biſtort-root</hi> in form of a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>Unto the affected part apply dolour reſtraining and aſſwaging medicaments.

                     <p>Sometimes it may be convenient to provoke ſweating (if at firſt ſweating difficultly come forth, then being cauſed by a Bathe of Spirit of wine, the Scabs will freely fall away) with <hi>Diaphoretick in peracutis,</hi> or rather with <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> whereby you will ſee a perfect Cure. Sometimes alſo purgations muſt be repeated with reſpect to the Diſeaſe and Patient.</p>
                     <p>Moreover there is a Specifick of crude <hi>Viridellus</hi> not ſeparated, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of any other Medicinal <hi>Eſſence,</hi> which in this caſe is excellent. It is not yet manifeſt, from what principle (<hi>

                     <p>It is moſt like from <hi>Sulphur,</hi> for <hi>Sulphur</hi> in <hi>Vitriol</hi> is of ſingular uſe, it is very near the Nature of <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> of which the <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> before mentioned is prepared. If <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> be prepared <hi>Volatile</hi> or <hi>Embrionate</hi> (ſee <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 8. <hi>Thorem.</hi> in my Treatiſe of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi>) and as in the preparation of <hi>Narcotick Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> be by it

This moſt pleaſant <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> is equivalent in vertue with <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with wonderful Effects. Doſe from <hi>Gr.</hi> j to iv in water of <hi>Meliſſa;</hi> It expells the noxious humours of the body, provokes Venery, rectifies the Womb, and repells its inordinate motion, and in either Sex ſtrengthens the Generative Seed. In water of <hi>Wild Alexander</hi> it is as good; moreover the Dropſie it perfectly cures. The uſe of this <hi>Eſſence</hi> muſt be continued for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>After the abſolute Cure, roughneſs of the skin is often wont to remain; yet after the noxious humours ſhall be totally expell'd from the Centre to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference through inſenſible tranſpirations by the uſe of thoſe noble medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, at length all the ſcales and ſcabs will ſpontaneouſly fall off. Allumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous aſtringent Salt will help.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, the more exterior hard ſcabs will ſtill remain; theſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward are mitigated and mollified by Bathes made of Emollient Herbs; but the moſt perfect and abſolute levigation of the ſkin is perfected by annointing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bathing with Oyl of <hi>Vipers</hi> or <hi>Land-ſnakes:</hi> The caſt ſkin of a <hi>Viper</hi> or <hi>Land-ſnake</hi> hath the ſignature of this Diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> (Brother <hi>Baſilius Valentinus</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Emperour, calls it <hi>Die neuue Krieger Kranckheit</hi>) unleſs it moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently diſcover it ſelf by little ſwellings and whelks in moſt parts of the body, chiefly in the forehead, and obſcene parts, eſpecially by breakings out in the thighs toward the knees, doth very often lye hid, and although of no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is ſcarcely rightly Cured, or if inveterate difficultly aſſwaged.</p>
                     <p>Therefore accurate judgment is in this caſe required, for the knowledge of the diſtemper principally depends upon the confeſſion of the Patient himſelf, (the Phyſitian in enquiring muſt be circumſpectly wiſe, leaſt the Patient evade a real anſwer;) for beſide thoſe four manifeſt degrees diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> there are more, which by reaſon of the community of ſymptoms with thoſe Diſeaſes are ſcarcely perceivable: All and every of which contagious copulation will declare, or the ſame committed with an infectious woman: If therefore the Patient be guilty of this, and alſo the ſymptoms be common, though this be unknown to the Phyſitian, it will be beſt, that all things may be rightly done, to proceed in the Cure, as if the Patient were infected with <hi>Lues Venerea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſtantly therefore obſerve this Rule.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If any one have pains in the thighs, ſhoulders and middle Ligaments, though no other external ſignes be apparent, yet he may be judged infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If any be infected with Meaſels, Tetter, or Piles of the Fundament, and have Whelks or Scabs in the skin of the body, about the neck or head, though no dolour of the ligaments be, he by the general Rule may be cenſured with the ſame cenſure.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If Tumours, Piles, and hidden Hemrodes poſſeſs the fundament, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene parts, whether dolours of the joynts be or be not, by the general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, from the number of the infected with this Diſeaſe he cannot be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In a body otherwiſe moſt lively, if great miſhapen Warts be, eſpecially in the hands; alſo if they appear in the lips and feet; if the Canon be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſhall ſcarcely be judged free from infection.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If one be afflicted with <hi>Cambuca,</hi> or after Copulation the paſſage of the Yard be obſtructed with Tumours, with heat and inflammation, or if there be ulceration of the Yard, or if he be afflicted with dolours of the joynts and head, or if not, yet he cannot but be numbred with the infected.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If one be troubled with <hi>Bubo</hi>'s, and ſcabbineſs about the privities, if he be, or be not, afflicted with dolour of the joynts, he can ſcarcely according to the Rule be pronounced free from infection.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Although none of all theſe be, and the body appear wholly clear; yet if in changes of the Moon, Air and Weather, the body be afflicted with dolours in the extremities, as hands and feet; yea, alſo in the head, although the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient acknowledge his being but once guilty, he hath the beginnings of this Diſeaſe growing upon him.</p>
                     <p>From theſe ſigns and certain tokens of any infection much benefit may accrue; of great benefit alſo would it be rightly to know the time of the Cure; therefore the Diſeaſe new or lately contracted, from the inveterate of long continuance ſhould be diſtinguiſhed rightly; for the former requires more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51328:207"/>ſhort and eaſie, the latter more long and Artificial Cure. The foundation and baſis of the Cure is placed in <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> duly and rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, in the uſe of which there is need of proper Vehicles, which may be ſupplyed with a decoction of <hi>Guaiacum-wood,</hi> root of <hi>Sarſaparilla</hi> (the ſtrings in the root <hi>Sarſaparilla</hi> muſt not be thrown away, for they are of excellent vertue) root of <hi>China, Lign-Saſſafras,</hi> and ſhavings of <hi>Oak-wood,</hi> in theſe-caſes is of excellent uſe among the poor ſort, ſometimes better than <hi>Lignum-Sanctum.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. With <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> expel the impurities of the body, and then again have recourſe to <hi>Hydroticks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hydroticks</hi> are Spirit of <hi>Guaiacum, Mixtura ſimplex, Crollius</hi> his <hi>Treacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> alſo <hi>Arcanum</hi> of <hi>Arſeſmart.</hi> In Diet <hi>Salt,</hi> which is the Conſerver of our <hi>Balſome;</hi> evilly therefore do Phyſitians prohibit the uſe of common Salt, in thoſe that are afflicted with the <hi>French Sickneſs.</hi> In the heat of the day the ſick may walk in the Air.</p>
                     <p>But if the Diſeaſe be plainly inveterate, theſe light gentle Medicaments are of little uſe, chiefly if the ſymptomes be urgent and very troubleſome, and the whole body aſſaulted on every ſide with the Diſeaſe it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Mercurial</hi> purgations are of principal uſe.</p>
                     <p>Sweatings may be provoked with <hi>Mercurials,</hi> but not unleſs fixed or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Among purging Medicaments, <hi>Crollius</hi> his ſublimate <hi>Mercury</hi> obtains the priority: Alſo the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of <hi>Coralls.</hi>

                     <p>Having this ſign, thence forward omit purgations (but not before four dayes, that in the firſt dayes <hi>Salivation</hi> may be moved,) and look to the excoriation of the mouth, jawes and tongue, (Food eaſie to ſwallow ſhould be eaten, as nutritive bothes, ſharp things muſt carefully be avoided) a Gargariſme made only with Salt and common-water will be ſufficient, with which the mouth muſt be often waſht hot for ſeveral hours; and ſo proceed.</p>

Notwithſtanding care muſt be taken leaſt the flux of <hi>Salivation</hi> be too ſoon reſtrained, (<hi>Note,</hi> aſtringent <hi>Gargariſmes</hi> mediate in <hi>Salivation</hi>) which is hardly to be feared as long as the aforeſaid <hi>Gargariſme</hi> is in continual uſe, which rather helps then hinders that Flux. Leaſt the ſpittle be ſwallowed in ſleep, put the knot of a handkerchif firſt moyſtned in brine between the teeth, ſo as by the opening of the mouth, the filthy matter may have more liberal paſſage. By the ſpontaneous ceſſation of which, if the more evident ſymptoms alſo ceaſe, the Cure indeed is thus far well performed; if otherwiſe, recourſe muſt either be had to the aforeſaid mundefying <hi>Mercurial,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation</hi> again procured, or <hi>Diaphoreticks</hi> only (alwayes <hi>Mercurial</hi>) may be uſed.</p>

In the end ſome of the remaining <hi>Mercury</hi> will be ſublimed, which at the end of the operation gather, and mix it with freſh red earth; make it up into balls, and dry it as before, and then by the uſual diſtillation urge the ſpirit, repeat the operation till all the ſublimed <hi>Mercury</hi> be reduced to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſomewhat ſharp in taſte, which preſerve in a veſſel well cloſed, and it will never looſe its ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>The red ſpirit, or red Oyl of <hi>Mercury,</hi> is thus prepared; ℞. Of moſt pure ſublimed <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> what quantity you pleaſe, grind it upon a marble to an impalpable powder, which with a like quantity of filings of Iron, put upon a glaſs plate, ſet it in ſome cold moiſt place for certain weeks (in the months of <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>July</hi>) and it will be reſolved into a yellow Oyl, which dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently gather. From the remaining <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> (from the Feces not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined) without fire (otherwiſe it will evaporate) extract a Salt. By the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of common water extract a Salt both from the <hi>Iron</hi> and the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which again coagulated joyn with the Oyl, and the colour will be converted like Cold or Saffron, this coagulate. This Oyl with its own Salt diſtill in a low Cucurbit (the lower the better) in ſand untill the water aſcend clear, which being diſtill'd off, augment the fire, and a redneſs will aſcend into the Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck like to Saffron, which may partly be gathered by a Receiver through the neck of the Limbeck (this muſt not be too long) part thereof will ſtick in the Limbeck like butter. Therefore urge the diſtillation with more ſtrong fire, untill no more will aſcend into the Limbeck. Cool the veſſel, and take off the Limbeck, and pour into the Cucurbit the Phlegm before diſtill'd, ſo as if any redneſs be lifted up to the ſides of the Cucurbit, it may with that water be waſhed off, and joyned with what remains in the bottom; which being done put on the Limbeck again, and repeat or renew the former diſtillation. As ſoon as the Limbeck begins to wax hot by the ſubtle vapours aſcending, that which was contained in the Limbeck will by little and little diſſolve and paſs through the neck into the Receiver exceeding red in colour, which with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51328:208"/>acurate diligence gather and joyn with the former red diſtill'd Oyl; when no more redneſs can be diſtill'd off, remove the Receiver, and in another gather the Phlegm, as in the firſt diſtillation; this being done again encreaſe the fire, that the remaining redneſs may be gathered, which will partly again be diſtili'd, and partly remain in the Limbeck: This muſt be provoked as often as need is.</p>
                     <p>Either of theſe <hi>Diaphoreticks</hi> is of great uſe, chiefly the red, of which <hi>Gr.</hi> j or ij in <hi>Treacle-water, Mixtura ſimplex,</hi> in ſpirit of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> or with other due vehicles exhibited, as Decoction of <hi>China,</hi> but eſpecially in water of <hi>Arſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmart,</hi> (if you pleaſe <hi>Tobacco</hi> water may be added) expells by ſweating whatſoever is noxious in the body, ſcarcely moveable by other Medicines: Whelks readily fall off, the little Tumours are diminiſhed, Dolours abated, and fetid remaining Ulcers dryed and conſolidated.</p>
                     <p>But if they be more contumacious, with a gentle annointing outwardly with this Oyl, only by touching them with a feather, they are happily cured. This Oyl is alſo uſeful in high putrid and fiſtulous Ulcers, alſo in the head when very much infected: For the affected parts being but once or twice touched with the ſaid Oyl, and by ſome of it inwardly taken ſweating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, a little after they are moſt happily-cured.</p>
                     <p>There is no <hi>Lues</hi> ſo obſtinate, but it gives place to theſe, where ſtrength is, to admit of ſufficient ſweating, which is alwayes required.</p>
                     <p>The white ſpirit is of like vertue, only ſomewhat more remiſs, yet by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain continuation it overcomes the evil it ſelf, and at length all ſymptomes are mitigated.</p>
                     <p>By theſe therefore hitherto named, the moſt inveterate <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> may eaſily be cured, if all other things rightly correſpond, that thence forward the Phyſitian need not be much diſturbed by the perillous appearance of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, ſince with diligent care the moſt dangerous may be removed.</p>

                     <p>This ſaid Oyl of <hi>Mercury</hi> is thus made; ℞. Moſt pure ſublimate <hi>Mercury,</hi> what quantity you pleaſe, reduce it to powder; and upon tin plates, <hi>(viz.)</hi> iron plates tinn'd over, diſſolve it <hi>per deliquium;</hi> diſtill the Solution with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wine ſo long, (<hi>viz.</hi> by often cohobating) as untill the ſpirit wax tart, which keep for uſe.

                     <p>Externalls are Plaiſters, ſuch is that noble Magiſtral <hi>Vigonis</hi> of <hi>Frogs;</hi> of which <hi>Platerus</hi> makes mention in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. of <hi>Obſervations,</hi> of <hi>Defaedation pag.</hi> 679. This plaiſter muſt be applyed to the head (the head being firſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) and worn till the dolours be removed; yet the plaiſter muſt be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, for by reaſon of the moyſture it draws from the head it will quickly be vitiated. The like plaiſters are in uſe by Practioners. Theſe plaiſters in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the joynts are alſo exceeding convenient.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the Bathes deſcribed by <hi>Ruland Cent.</hi> 10. <hi>Curat.</hi> 2. do in this caſe yield ſome relief.</p>
                     <p>Moreover cavities of the jaws, with excoriation and loſs of the <hi>

                     <p>It is judged the Cure of theſe may be perfected ſometimes by internal medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, yet often after many internal remedies have been tryed, they have proved unſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>Here Gargariſms and other Oyntments are highly commended. Moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is the Gargariſm deſcribed for affects of the mouth, which mundeſies and dryes.</p>
                     <p>But if this neither effect any thing, the green water treated of in the ſame place, being applyed with a pencil or cotton to the jaws by touching and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Cavities, doth wholly cleanſe the exulceration, and egregiouſly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Cure.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they are ſo malignant, as by theſe they are not abated, chiefly if they penetrate far, and come to the bones of the palate.</p>
                     <p>Moſt excellent is the Solution of Gold, after this manner:</p>
                     <p>℞. Of Salt fuſe, purified Salt, and roch-Salt, of each ℥ j, add half a book of Leaf-gold, grinde them together prudently, imbibing them with ſome drops of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and long grind them upon a Marble. Upon this mixture in a ſmall Cucurbit pour ſpirit of wine to cover it two fingers, leave it for ſome time in aſhes, the veſſel being very well cloſed, afterward boyle it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that the Salts may be diſſolved, but the ſpirit will wax yellow. Then draw off the Spirit of wine by a Limbeck, till it be dry. Pour on freſh ſpirit of wine, and again digeſt it in aſhes, and ſo the leaf-gold will be reſolved by the ſpirit of wine, and the Salts be left in the bottom. Repeat this extraction the ſecond and third time, untill all the gold be plainly reſolved and extracted.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51328:209"/>Laſtly, by diſtillation draw off the ſpirit of wine till the gold be dry, upon which pour moſt pure ſpirit of <hi>Turpentine</hi> to cover one or two fingers; leave it for eight dayes in a hot place, untill all the gold be diſſolved. With this diſſolved gold touch the affected place with cotten twice a day for ſome time, (at firſt it ſeems to corrode, but by little and little it abates) and moreover uſe Gargariſms, and you will ſee the deſired cure quickly follow. The ſame ſolution and extraction of gold is powerful in external Ulcers, not remedied by other Medicines: (<hi>Mercury</hi> hath a famous incarnative force:) Of like ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is common Oyl, in which red ſublimate <hi>Mercury</hi> is tranſmuted by boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Oyl it ſelf will at length become very black.</p>
                     <p>In Venereal Tumours, contracted hardneſs, and huge knottineſſes of the bones, and grievous dolours, for the moſt part more vehemently afflicting by night, the plaiſters above mentioned are very powerful. Alſo that of <hi>Platerus</hi> Part 3. <hi>Praxi.</hi> pag. 505 is of no ſmall vertue. Yet moſt excellent is this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ℞. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. Aureum Officin.</hi> ℥ iij, <hi>Mercury</hi> ſublimate ℥ j; mix theſe, and with a linuen cloth apply it to the part for a day or two; but the knotted place muſt firſt be waſhed with red wine, and ſo the knots will happily abate. Yet in very old Tumours, and of long continuance, it muſt be longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but not by application in form of a plaiſter, but by annointing only twice or thrice a day as long as need ſhall be.</p>
                     <p>The Dolours and Tumours being removed, ſupple the affected place with a cloth annointed with unſalted butter, and waſh it with wine; ſo the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour will not only be removed, but all vitious humours extracted totally from the tumorous member, and afterward tumours of this kind will ſeldom or never grow again, (if the tumour abate not, it may be opened, expreſt and cleanſed.) I had an Example of this in the arm of a moſt Noble Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>Foulneſs of the ſkin is manifold, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Welkes, little Bladders, Warts, Sores, Scabs, Meaſels, Tetters, and other various and innumerable Species, which receive their variety from the difference of Subjects.</p>
                     <p>For without controverſie there is in the external habit of the body almoſt as many Species of <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> to be found, as there are individualls; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome is ſo tempered with the humours of the body themſelves, or rather with the blood, that whatever variety of Salts domineer in the blood, or lye hid therein, as many diverſities alſo outwardly appear, flouriſhing like fruit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting themſelves to Nature, and undermining her roots.</p>
                     <p>All theſe external vices of the skin, by internal Cures chiefly <hi>Mercurial,</hi> are for the moſt part abated and healed; yet very often the contumacy of the Diſeaſe is ſuch, and ſo highly radicated, that by internal Medicaments, which indeed may reach to the external parts, they cannot be removed, where the whole evil is as it were tranſplanted and radicated in the habit of the body. That therefore in theſe caſes the diligence of the Phyſitian may be manifeſt, He muſt thus proceed:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whelks, and other vices of the Face, are thus Cured.</p>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> ℥ iv, <hi>Silver</hi> ℥ ij, diſſolve theſe apart in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joyne the ſolutions, and from the ſolutions diſtill a water by Retort or Cucurbit in ſand with ſtrong fire. The Liquor drawn off, diſtill <hi>in Balneo,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till no more is ſeen to come forth, the remaining liquor keep for uſe. With this liquor touch the Whelks, Warts, Bladders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> apart daily, or only once, and at length they will wax black, and the Salts dye; leave them ſo (without any other annointing) for four dayes, and the cruſted skins will freely fall off:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51328:210"/>if they fall not, annoint them with freſh butter, and this will preſently be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: After this, ℞. Sugar of <hi>Saturn</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Roſe-water,</hi> and with it annoint the places, (with a ſmall feather, before it be nine times uſed they will be healed) where the Whelkes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were, and they will quickly be Cured, the blemiſhes and red ſpots alſo vaniſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of like vertue is Oyl of <hi>Verdegreaſe</hi> made <hi>per diliquium:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Verdegreaſe</hi> one part, <hi>Salt Nitre</hi> two parts; mix them, and in a diſh ſet fire of it with a cole or paper, afterward what remains diſſolve in a cold moiſt place, or put it in a Hogs bladder; tye the bladder very cloſe, and plunge it in water, and ſo it will quickly be diſſolved, (uſe this with Cotton.) The uſe is the ſame with the former.</p>
                     <p>Scabs, Meaſels, Tetters, alſo clefts in the palmes of the hands, and ſoles of the feet, hardly exterminable by the preceding univerſal medicaments, may thus be very well cured: ℞. <hi>Hogs-greaſe</hi> what quantity you pleaſe, mix it with Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> made <hi>per diliquium,</hi> untill the <hi>

After the Ulcers are well cleanſed, conſolidate them with the following plaiſter, which is famous, and in other putrified Ulcers cleanſed very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ſame plaiſter cures Ulcers, that are not too deep. Moreover it is a moſt excellent <hi>Epulotick</hi> and <hi>Incarnative.</hi> It is thus made; ℞.

                     <p>But if the Ulcers be very contumacious, as they are wont to be, this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing playſter may be uſed:</p>

                     <p>By this means therefore theſe kind of Tumours of <hi>Lues-venerea,</hi> are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Tumours attending the Peſt.</p>
                     <p>The way of Curing <hi>Buboes</hi> of this kind is moſt plain:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Ripen the <hi>Bubo</hi> with a plaiſter of <hi>Diaculon,</hi> (for there is alwayes need of ripening) or an <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Part of an Owle.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Owle</hi> moyſtned in vinegar, and applyed to the <hi>Bubo,</hi> when it begins to ſwell remove it, and apply another; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue applying the <hi>Owle</hi> or the plaiſter till the <hi>Bubo</hi> be ſoftned; then with a penknife open it, and expreſs the corrupt filth and blood. After this an <hi>Opodeldoh</hi> muſt be applyed, which will not ſuffer the Ulcer at all to cloſe, till it be perfectly healed from the bottom.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in this very Cure, as in all other ſymptoms of <hi>Lues-venerea,</hi> no part of the internal Cure muſt be at all omitted: For it is known that often in this kind of Tumours of the Groine, the only repeating of the inward uſe of <hi>Mercury</hi> (ſublimed <hi>Merc.</hi> or Oyl of <hi>Merc.</hi>) hath in time removed them, ſo as by the <hi>Mercurial</hi> operation internally the courſe of the evil is wholly extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:51328:211"/>
The lately contracted <hi>Lues-venerea</hi> hath a Chryſtaline ſymptom, ſo called, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a little tranſparent bladder growing upon the gland of the privy part, whence it is ſo denominated.</p>
                     <p>If this be not exquiſitely Cured with proper Remedies, it is mortal. It will not abide a ſtroke, nor will it admit of conſolidation, though Remedies properly helpful in other <hi>venereal nlcerations</hi> be applyed.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of <hi>Tobacco</hi> is here only commended, nevertheleſs the internal Cure muſt be alſo adminiſtred; ſo at length all things will moſt happily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; where this bladder is firſt mortified (the bladder already morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, being but only touched with the ſpirit three or four times doth preſently vaniſh) there touch it five times at moſt with the ſpirit of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and it will ſpontaneouſly fall off, and this muſt be done while the Patient lies down; otherwiſe a very gentle touch of the ſpirit of <hi>Tobacco</hi> will cauſe him to fall, (that is, it benums, and ſo cauſes the party to fall) See above of the ſpirit of <hi>Tobacco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this method of Curing a Friend of mine confeſſed he gained 1000 Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of Gold; I may ſay, and truly affirm, that in all my whole practiſe, no Cure had more happy and proſperous ſucceſs then this, which I now perfectly and candidly deliver and communicate to you.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of <hi>Lues-venerea</hi> various wayes of curing are deviſed by ſundry men.</p>
                     <p>Among vulgar wayes this following is moſt approved:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Purge the body with ſome <hi>Apozeme</hi> or <hi>Opiat;</hi> vulgarly is only uſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Hamech,</hi> with Electuary of <hi>Diacarthamus,</hi> or with <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij and <hi>Gr.</hi> v of juice of <hi>Roſes</hi> in a common purging decoction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. After purgation, if great pain in the head be, a vein may be opened, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by no means.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then make an Unguent of freſh <hi>Hogs</hi> greaſe, if it may be had, or of that which hath been long kept, if not rank or ſalted, the quantity of <abbr>lb</abbr> j or more, and ℥ ij of <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> or more in juice of <hi>Lemmons,</hi> or which is better, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in <hi>Turpentine.</hi>
                     </p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent</hi> annoint the ſhanks and knees before a furnace, or other good fire, and if the Diſeaſe be vehement, the back alſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Which being done provoke ſweat leiſurely, by encloſing the ſick in ſome encloſure proper for this Diſeaſe, to which about the feet muſt be put burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coles, that he may ſweat the better; it is convenient to do this in ſome hot or well cloſed chamber, where no air may come in, that the evacuation may be perfect. Annoint the Patient once a day for the firſt three dayes <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the morning betimes; this may be continued four or five mornings; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uſe it twice a day, that is to ſay, in the morning, and three hours after dinner: Afterward again continue the annointing in the mornings only, untill a <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Ptyaliſme,</hi> or ſpitting much, begin to appear, as ſoon as this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears forbear annointing, yet not untill you ſee the ſpittle flow out of the mouth in abundance; then be ſure to forbear annointing, and keep the Patient alwayes in Bed, or in a Stove, untill the <hi>Ptyaliſme</hi> ceaſe; which if it continue above eight or nine dayes, make a Gargariſme of aſtringents, as <hi>Mouſe-ear, Myrtleberries, Knotgraſs, Pomegranate flowers,</hi> to which add a little <hi>Aqua-mortua,</hi> with ſome honey of <hi>Roſes,</hi> or <hi>Aqua-mortua</hi> alone allayed with a decoction of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> and the mouth waſht therewith.</p>

                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:51328:211"/>
Alſo at that time the gums and whole mouth may be ſo inflamed, that the ſick can eat nothing, but a little bread firſt moyſtned in broth. As ſoon as the <hi>Ptyaliſme</hi> ceaſes, the teeth and gums muſt be waſhed, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things are doing, drink may be wanted, which will be beſt to be made of a decoction of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>Alſo during the whole time of the Cure, let the ſick abſtain from all ſalts, and if poſſibly he can from common Salt.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the Flux ceaſes, let liquids be forborn, and boyled meats uſed; for ſeveral dayes let him drink twice of a decoction of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> or ſuch like as this.</p>

To this may be added a little <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Liquoriſh</hi> and <hi>Raiſons.</hi> Let this ſecond decoction be uſed inſtead of drink. The twice taking the firſt decoction for provoking ſweat, muſt be done in the morning, and three hours after dinner alwayes in a Bed or Stove after the taking it.</p>
                     <p>It is beſt, that every fifth or ſixth day the body be purged, during the whole time of the Cure, with Confection of <hi>Hamech,</hi> or <hi>Citron; Diacarthamus,</hi> or with juice of <hi>Roſes,</hi> if he be poor, but if rich, a <hi>Magiſtral Syrup</hi> or <hi>Apozeme</hi> may be made.</p>

The Sick may take the <hi>Apozeme</hi> at four a clock in the morning, and abſtaine from eating or drinking till nine or ten, or if poſſibly he can till noon; Eight dayes after taking the <hi>Mercury,</hi> make the following decoction: ℞. Root of <hi>Sarſaparilla</hi> freſh <abbr>lb</abbr> 
                        <abbr>ſs</abbr>, ſhavings of <hi>Lignum Sanctum</hi> ℥ iv, <hi>China</hi> not corrupted ℥ ij; infuſe theſe in <abbr>lb</abbr> x of water for twenty four hours, afterwards boyle it till two parts be conſumed: Of this when ſtrained give the ſick ℥ iv, with ſix drops of the Oyl of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and let him ſweat either in a Stove, or elſe in Bed, in the morning betimes, or three hours after dinner; continue the uſe of this ten dayes, if the Diſeaſe be not very inveterate, but if it ſo be, for fifteen dayes.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes Mineral <hi>Bezoar</hi> may be given to provoke ſweating more freely; this ſweating is beſt in a Stove, in which a hole muſt be left for his eyes and noſe, that he may be better breath; as ſoon as he comes into the Stove make a ſuffumigation with <hi>Cinaber</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or in defect thereof, with common <hi>Cinaber,</hi> in quantity <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j, and with red <hi>Storax Calamita</hi>

                     <p>Alſo it will be expedient, that the ſick wear a large plaiſter like a Stomacher, chiefly if the Diſeaſe be inveterate, made of the Plaiſter of <hi>Vigonis</hi> with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> ſo as it may cover the parts of the <hi>precordia,</hi> and below the ſtomack, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the bottom of the belly.</p>

                     <p>Falling out of the teeth, and ulceration of the Gums, is helped either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally or particularly by this Cure, as is aboveſaid.

                     <p>After the body is well corrected blemiſhes ſpontaneouſly fall off, therefore need no peculiar help.</p>
                     <p>Ulcers in the body, chiefly about the ſhanks, are cured in the ſame manner as we have already ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Tops of <hi>Madder</hi> infuſed in wine are convenient, the infuſion being uſed to waſh the Ulcers, which, with the ſame in a decoction muſt afterward be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is often wont to return, eſpecially in ſome conſtitutions, where it lurks uneſpied and privily gets familiarity: But if the body be well cleanſed at the proper ſeaſons of the year, and orderly diet, with legitimate obſervation to avoid the ſix unnatural things, be appointed, it ſeldom or never can manifeſt its cruelty. For the moſt part thoſe whom it once thus invades, it very ſeldom forſakes. Yet from this evident Cure it is hoped, and indeed certainly known, that there is no <hi>Scurvy,</hi> how deformed ſo ever, but may (if other things correſpond) with an ingenious hand, and the right exhibition of Specificks, be perfectly cured: to which the exquiſite diligence and prudence of the Phyſitian, with a true deſire to perform things rightly, is alſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>The experience of this Cure is ſomewhat confirmed by the teſtimony of the Noble <hi>Weſt-Phalians,</hi> who ſtill ſend me ſome tokens of their gratitude. So much for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> now follow <hi>Feavers,</hi> with their Cures.</p>

                     <p>In rightly Curing all <hi>Feavers,</hi> properly ſo called, this muſt principally be minded, that the Cure be not raſhly or diſorderly performed.</p>
                     <p>For although Specificks are ſaid to remove all peccant humours, in the Cure of every Diſeaſe, yet theſe without method or judgement exhibited, are of little or no vertue, for the ſettled impurities of the body by their innate power,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51328:214"/>do wonderfully oppoſe the Specificks; yet as alſo in all other Diſeaſes, ſo in this, theſe are not to be neglected.</p>
                     <p>In this place all the evacuating Medicines above preſcribed are of excellent uſe, yet ſo as the temperature of the body, age, ſex, and ſtrength be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antimony</hi> is a purging Specifick in all <hi>Feavers,</hi> except the <hi>Hectick;</hi> the flowers of which rightly fitted and prepared expell all Feaveriſh impurities from the body: The flowers may be reduced to an Oyl; which by precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be reduced to an <hi>Emetick</hi> powder, if the Baſis of the precipitation be Simple water; or into a powder only purging downward, if the Baſis of the precipitation be Oyl of <hi>Tartar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note well,</hi> whether the Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> after precipitation ſhould long be left, (with <hi>Crollius</hi>) or preſently be removed. The latter is affirmed, otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Antimony</hi> would be too much fixed.</p>
                     <p>Either of theſe powders in a juſt Doſe legitimately exhibited in intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and continual <hi>Feavers,</hi> mitigates them very much, chiefly if at firſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly other medicaments be adminiſtred, it moves and expells the very root of evil from the body.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes Obſtructions moſt obſtinate abide, in the Liver, Meſeraick veins, Spleen and <hi>Meſentery</hi> it ſelf, alſo in the Reins, which move and propagate the malignant humours, therefore they are diligently to be removed with one or other of the aforeſaid Evacuations, by often exhibitions.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe Digeſtives of <hi>Vitriolate Tartar,</hi> Cream of <hi>Tartar,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Vitriol, Aperient Penotums,</hi> and Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> are of excellent uſe; then which nothing can be more profitable, if adminiſtred in convenient Vehicles, and ſuch as are proper to remove obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>The Obſtructions thus reſolved and moved, mundefying Medicaments more rightly operate, and render the Cure of <hi>Feavers</hi> more proſperous.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo neceſſary Vomitories in this caſe, eſpecially in <hi>Feavers</hi> of the Ventricle, and <hi>Quotidians</hi> produced of Phlegm, wherein <hi>Aqua bened.</hi> often exhibited is ſingularly profitable.</p>

                     <p>There is another Magnetick Plaiſter of ſingular uſe in the Peſtilence, the moſt powerful ingredient or baſis whereof is <hi>Arſenical Magnet,</hi> artificially prepared after this manner: ℞.

                     <p>In perfect curing Scabs of every kind the cleanſing of the blood is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needful: For in the evil affected blood abounding with ſalt, vitriolate aluminous aſtringent impurities, this ſo great an evil is cloſely ſetled between the skin and the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The Cure therefore muſt be effected with mundefying medicines, as <hi>Mercur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulcis, Mercur. vitae, Arcanum</hi> of <hi>Coralls,</hi> Extract of <hi>Panchymagogon,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>If Obſtructions are found to be in the body, and they before purgations be exhibited, care muſt be taken to remove them firſt, without which, the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Scabbineſs will ſcarcely be abated. Afterward the blood being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Obſtructions removed, correctives may more happily be introduced, and ſo the deſired Cure follow.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe Magiſtery and Tincture of <hi>Coralls</hi> are highly commended; Flowers of fixt white <hi>Antimony</hi> given in a decoction or ſpirit of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> take away the contumacious Scabbineſs accompanied with troubleſome Itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

                     <head>The Volatile Scab.</head>
                     <p>There is a kind of Scab, which <hi>Fallopius</hi> calls <hi>Volatile,</hi> by reaſon of its ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diſperſing it ſelf all over the skin of the body: For oftentimes it hath been ſeen, that this Evil hath in one night ſpread it ſelf all over the body, as it were by flying, taking poſſeſſion of all parts.</p>
                     <p>Phyſitians ſay there is a uſual ſpreading of blood on the Superficies of the body, as in St. <hi>Antonies fire,</hi> without any Scab. Nevertheleſs this <hi>Volatick</hi> Scab, can never be cured as that other ſpreading of blood is cured. This Evil hath been often ſeen, even to death it ſelf, obſtinately to reject all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe indeed all neceſſary things ought to be done, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by purging and ſweating; but when the Evil is thruſt out to the circumference of the body, it admits of hardly any external Cure.

                     <p>Indeed this kind of help is uſeful in common practiſe, but if the ſame be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, or the Diſeaſed be far remote from ſuch Bathes; there are other things which may moſt commodiouſly be uſed, from whence oftentimes the Cure is more happily affected at home.</p>
                     <p>The body muſt be cleanſed with kindly purgations; ſuch are theſe: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of <hi>Hellebore, Rubarb, Mechoacanna, Panchymagogon vegitable;</hi> alſo among Minerals, famous is the Specifick purge of <hi>Antimonial Pills</hi> purging both ways, or thoſe that only purge downwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> Mercurial Medicines cannot here be profitably uſed; nor <hi>Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida</hi> or <hi>Elateries:</hi> For by their ſubſtantial humidities, they are of little or no effect.</p>
                     <p>If Obſtructions in the body be ſtrong, which indeed are wont both to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and follow Contractures, theſe muſt be removed with Medicines proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolving Obſtructions, both vulgar and Chymical.</p>
                     <p>Then the whole habit of the body muſt be reduced to a temperate equality of neceſſary moyſture: To which purpoſe Bathes prepared of emollient and moyſtning Herbs are very convenient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> In lean bodies Stoves do much more hurt then good; moreover in every Bathing, ſome of the Tincture of <hi>Antimony</hi> ſhould be given in a juſt Doſe, with convenient vehicles, as water of <hi>Lillies</hi> of the valley, that alſo in the time of Bathing, ſweat may be ſomewhat provoked, to flow from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the body.</p>

                     <p>Having mentioned theſe, we now come to external medicaments, among many others, this following is principally excellent, and is thus: ℞. Roots of <hi>Angelica</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51328:221"/>and after boyle it gently till half be conſumed; then ℞. Of excellent <hi>Rheniſh</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wine <abbr>lb</abbr> iv, in which diſſolve of the beſt <hi>Saffron</hi> pulveriſate <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij; heat the wine over coals leiſurely in a convenient veſſel, and put in of <hi>Venice-ſope</hi> the beſt that can be got, cut very ſmall <abbr>lb</abbr> j, keep it continually ſtirring till the <hi>Sope</hi> be plainly diſſolved; which being done, add Oyl of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine</hi> and <hi>Juniper,</hi> of each <abbr>ſs</abbr> a part, mix them diligently, and by further boyling joyn them with the mucilaginous ſubſtance of <hi>Angelica</hi> roots, untill the whole be reduced to a juſt Conſiſtency. With this Unguent annoint the whole body, and eſpecially in thoſe places where the contracture more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abides; this do alwayes after going out of the Bath: Every other day repeat both the uſe of the Bath and Unction, untill it be done nine times: By this means the Nerves and Ligaments are looſned, and the Patient reſtored to his priſtine vigour.</p>
                     <p>This Cure is more happily and ſpeedily effected, if with the <hi>Tincture of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> before bathing three or four drops of diſtilled Oyl of <hi>Angelica</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There are Vulnerary Balſomes, alſo Potions very profitable to conſolidate wounds, of which Authors do alſo adviſe.</p>
                     <p>Famous is the vulnerary Balſome of <hi>Felix Wurtzius,</hi> which is every where commended, and is indeed of greater vertue then is uſually deſcribed; theſe two following principal properties it hath, that (if all other things be legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately performed) it exquiſitely Cures the wound, and that in a very ſhort time.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The vulnerary Balſome is thus made:</head>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Galbanum, Ammoniack, Bdellium,</hi> of each ℥ <abbr>ſs</abbr>, macerate them three dayes in vinegar, then ſtrain the Liquor, and after the uſuall manner thicken it to the conſiſtency of <hi>Honey:</hi> Afterward ℞. of fine red <hi>Myrrh,</hi> of the beſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,</hi> of each ℥ <abbr>ſs</abbr>, <hi>Olibanum</hi> ℥ j; to theſe when finely pulveriſate, add of <hi>Larix Turpentine,</hi> Oyl <hi>Olive,</hi> of each ℥ ij; boyle them together over a moſt gentle Fire, ſtirring them continually, until the latter Gums be well melted, then again add ℥ j of Oyl <hi>Olive,</hi> and with gentle heat boyle it; and ſo go on, alwayes adding ℥ j of the Oyl <hi>Olive,</hi> untill a whole pound be ſo uſed, keeping it alwayes ſtirring: This being done, mix the Gums before diſſolved in vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and afterward ſtreined and thickned, by continual ſtirring in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and as before by ounces pour in Oyl <hi>Olive,</hi> untill another pound of the Oyl be added, and then the Balſome will contract a yellowiſh colour.</p>
                     <p>But if you deſire the ſame Balſome ſhould be green, add ℥ j of <hi>Verdegreaſe</hi> pulveriſate, and leave it in the Sun for a month and more; the Feces will by little and little precipitate the bottom, from which, what is pure muſt be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and in clean veſſels kept for uſe.</p>

                     <p>Green wounds made either with Cuts or Pricks are by this balſome ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, if only a ſmall part thereof be moderately hot, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as hot as the Patient can well endure, put into the wound, yet ſo as the whole cavity of the wound be exactly filled; for otherwiſe the Superiour parts will be healed
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51328:225"/>up, and the inferiour remain raw, whereby bad ſymptoms will ariſe: But if with the wound a vein be alſo cut, it muſt be bound up carefully, and the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome infuſed; this continued for four dayes at leaſt, if the legature be aptly placed, the wound will be perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>Some do ſometimes in theſe caſes uſe (not the aforeſaid Balſome) a conglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinating powder, which is made of River <hi>Crabs;</hi> Thus, ℞. <hi>Crabs</hi> whole, while they are alive, and freſh taken out of the River, in the month of <hi>June,</hi> when the Moon is in the ſign <hi>Cancer,</hi> (at that time their ſhells are render) put them in an earthen pot, and dry them in an Oven, but ſo as they may neither burn, nor touch the fire, but be fit by drying to be reduced to powder eaſily. This powder put into wounds, yea, though very deep, but with this caution, that all the cavities be perfectly filled; otherwiſe where the powder touches not the bottom, the wound in the top will indeed be conſolidated, but its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating corruption in the bottom cannot be hindred: This therefore muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be diligently minded, otherwiſe wounds newly healed muſt be again lanced.</p>
                     <p>Another Balſome of excellent uſe in wounds, is thus made;</p>
                     <p>℞. As much ear-wax as can be got, add it to Oyl of <hi>Wallnuts</hi> made by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, boyle them together, untill with gentle heat, the Oyl be ſomewhat thick like a Balſome.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of this is wonderful in moſt ſpeedy curing all wounds, for it excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently conſolidates, and perfectly frees from putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>Here may be reckoned <hi>Rulands</hi> Balſome of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and plaiſter of <hi>Diaſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> whoſe laudable vertues are evident.</p>
